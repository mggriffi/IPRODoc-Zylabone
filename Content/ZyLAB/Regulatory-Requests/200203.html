        <h1>Identify, Tag and Order the most Relevant Data</h1>
        <p>A manual search becomes tedious and time consuming, especially if the company has limited time to submit all of the data (i.e., ten (10) days according to the ACM in The Netherlands). This action can be performed by <a href="../ONE/1020.html" target="_top">topic modeling</a> in order to expand the search and place the data in different groups. With this function, you are also able to <a href="../ONE/691.html" target="_top">bulk tag</a> the data. The next step will be to identify the hot-docs and W-questions (i.e., who, what, when, where). This will enable the researcher to narrow down unknown or extensive keyword searches.
