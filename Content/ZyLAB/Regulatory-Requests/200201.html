        <h1>Identify &amp; Remove LPP</h1>
        <p>
 Once all of the documents have been formatted to be searchable, you will be able to categorize the information. The following step is to identify and remove the legal professional privilege (“LPP”) documents.

        <p>It is imperative to remove these documents to ensure attorney-client confidentiality, as you have a legal right to keep these conversation private. LPP documents fall outside the scope of the ACM’s investigations and legally does not have to be included in the documentation process.
