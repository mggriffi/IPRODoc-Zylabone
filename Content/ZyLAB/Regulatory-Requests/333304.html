        <h2>Take a Data Driven Approach<br /></h2>
        <p>Traditionally within competition investigations, external third-party data scientists and other technical professional would be brought in to assist with the competition investigations and gathering of information. ZyLAB has circumnavigated that issue by fully automating&#160;this&#160;process. 
  <br /></p>
        <p>  As we can no longer read through all documents from start to end, we take a more data focused approach: </p>
        <p><![CDATA[
  ]]><ol class="listnumber"><li class="listnumber">
   We make <a href="200200.html">all data fully searchable</a> (this is what we call Deep Processing).</li><li class="listnumber">
    We <a href="200201.html">identify and remove Legally Privilege Protected data</a> (LPP).</li><li class="listnumber">
    We <a href="200202.html">identify and remove all data of which we are very certain it is not relevant</a> (NR) such as newsletters, spam, personal email, etc.  
    
    </li><li class="listnumber">
    We <a href="200203.html">identify, tag and order all data of which we are certain that it is relevant</a> and related to the case using a variety of smart search tooling.  
    
    </li><li class="listnumber"><a href="200204.html">Use machine learning to analyze the rest of the data</a>: We now have a certain amount of data left that does not belong in any of the above categories (step 2 to 4). What we can now do, is teach the computer (using machine learning)&#160;what is not relevant (#3) and what is relevant (#4) and let the computer automatically classify the remaining data using these classifiers. 
    
    </li></ol></p>
        <p>Using this approach, we can in-fact analyze all data, without the need to read everything. This is a much more effective approach, which is not only allowed by courts around the world, but there are more and more courts and regulatory agencies who recommend or even mandate the above approach.<br /></p>
        <p>Follow the 5 steps mentioned above to setup a typical Competition matter.<br /></p>
