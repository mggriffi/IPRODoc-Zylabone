        <h1>Competition Litigation: Handling Information Requests</h1>
        <p>
  
  Companies suspected of infringing competition/antitrust laws and regulations encounter information requests or they can expect a visit from the relevant authorities. Legally, these claims are brought about by an individual or legal entity. Claims for damages arise out of “follow-on claims” out of prior decisions from the European Commission (“Commission”) or the national competition authorities, i.e., the Dutch Competition Authority (Autoriteit Consument en Markt, “ACM”). The Establishment Act of the Authority for Consumers and Markets serves as the legal basis for the ACM and their investigative powers. 
  <br /></p>
        <p>If the cause of the investigation pertains to cartels that are dispersed amongst four or more Member States of the European Union, then the Commission shall be brought in to investigate. If there are less than three Member States involved, then the ACM or relevant national authorities will carry out the investigation. 
  <br /></p>
        <p>When a company provides limited information, the relevant authorities may send a request for additional information. External third-party lawyers may be employed by the companies to ensure that the submission of all documents. Regardless, the company bares full responsibility for ensuring that all the information is correct. In addition to an information request, authorities may organize what is known as a “dawn-raid”; such raids consist of an unannounced company visitation, intended to uncover all information to aid in their investigation. Following the initial raid, the authorities may return on a following date to gather additional information. 
   </p>
        <p>Two data forms are excluded from the scope of the ACM’s investigations; non-business-related data: i.e., personal emails not related to business operations such as spam emails, and legal professional privilege (“LPP”). Privileged documentation consists of communications amongst the attorney and their client, guaranteeing the right to non-disclosure. Notification of competition infringements are to be made within the competence of either the Member State or the Commission. Standard notifying forms are known as “Form CO”&#160;alongside request forms “Form RS”.&#160;In essence, the documents must answer whether the concentration complies with the competition law requirements. Formation of a concentration is reported through the relevant authority, while in the United States it is conducted through the FTC’s Premerger Office (PNO)&#160;or the Department of Justice (“DOJ”).&#160;Doubts concerning the concentration following the primary report will be followed up by the FTC through a “second request”. The contents of this report focus on all relevant data on the concentration to verify if it fair. To ease the request process for companies, the PNO has provided a manual (<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/merger-review/may2019_model_second_request_final.pdf" target="_blank">PNO-Second Request Manual</a>).
  </p>
        <p> If the ACM suspects a violation of any competition laws or regulations, they will initiate a thorough data investigation by retaining the data from the company in question. Following the retention and processing any potentially relevant data, the ACM will provide their findings back to the company for assessment. The company has the right to exclude particular information from the investigative procedure if the information is safeguarded by legal professional privileged (LPP) or not relevant (NR). The company then has ten (10) days to compile the information and complete the assessment. 
  
  </p>
        <p><b>Legal Basis</b>
        </p>
        <p> Claims for violations of competition law are typically based on tort claims (Article 6:162 of the Dutch Civil Code, “DCC”). Violations of competition law constitute a breach of a statutory duty (wettelijke plicht) and as such, qualify as a tortious act (onrechtmatige daad). Claims may additionally be brought up under: (A) Article 6:74 DCC; (B) Article 6:212 DCC; (C) Article 6:203 DCC. As stated in the aforementioned paragraph, claims arise out of EU and national laws. Tort claims are reflected based on Article 101 and 102 TFEU (the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant position) which constitutes a tortious act.
