        <p><b>Orientation</b>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>Produce all images with Portrait,&#160;Landscape or Auto-detect orientation. With Auto-detect, images are produced based on the detected orientation of the original document.
          Images are downscaled to fit (keeping the aspect ratio). Images are never cropped. 
          
        
          </p>
        <p><b>Output Format</b>
        </p>
        <p>Choose from Singlepage TIFF, Multipage TIFF, Searchable PDF and Searchable PDF (quality).
       
          <b>&#160;</b></p>
        <p><b>Image Size</b>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>Choose from Letter (8.5x11.0 in/216x279 mm), A4 (8.3x11.7 in/210x297 mm), Legal (8.5x14.0 in/216x356 mm) or Auto. The original image size will be produced; this will overrule the Orientation setting.
        
          <b>&#160;</b></p>
        <p><b>Resolution</b>
        </p>
        <p>The lower the resolution, the less disk space you will need. However, the risk of data loss will increase. Choose from 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or 600 dpi.
        
          </p>
        <p><b>Color Settings</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Recommended Settings:</b>
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p>For black and white: 1 bit color and 300 dpi<br />For color: 24 bit color and 200 DPI</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Not Recommended:</b>
                </p>
                <p>8 bit color and 8 bit greyscale. Use only for specific use cases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When potential data loss is an issue, for example when converting from color to black and white,  produce color images. Note that the  resulting files will take up more space.
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>+ Produce as Full Color</b>&#160;/ <b><i>n</i> as Full Color</b><![CDATA[              ]]></p>
                        <p>If you selected 1 or 8 bit, you can produce - as an exception - a number of images in full color (24 bit).<br />Select the file types you want to produced in full color.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Units and Margin</b>
        </p>
        <p>The margin can be set in inches or centimeters.
Fields are burned next to the image. If the margin is set too small, fields will be burned (partly) on top of the image.

        
        
          <b>&#160;</b></p>
        <p><b>Compression</b>
        </p>
        <p>You do not need to define the Compression, as it is related to the chosen color&#160;setting. It is displayed here for your convenience.        <b>&#160;</b></p>
        <p><b>Remove Blank Pages</b>
        </p>
        <p>This option is often used for spreadsheets. As spreadsheets can be very large, they are often divided into several pages. Information may appear on only a few pages. The remaining blank pages can be removed.
Sometimes it is not advised to remove blank pages, as this may in itself be important information. For example, someone might have deleted incriminating content.
