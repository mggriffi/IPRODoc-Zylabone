        All documents of the initial training set size are reviewed. If not, the request for a new training batch will be ignored. The reviewer has to finish review of the initial training set.

      Training Statistics
      <br /></b>
    Precision is a measure of result relevancy, while recall is a measure of how many truly relevant results are returned. High scores for both precision and recall show that the classifier is returning accurate results (high precision), as well as returning a majority of all positive results (high recall).

        Estimated Current Recall&#160;
