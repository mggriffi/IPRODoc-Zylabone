        <p>ZyINDEX creates and manages all components of your archives that contain scanned and electronic information.
  </p>
        <h3>Searchable Archives</h3>
        <p>The structure of a ZyINDEX archive is comparable with the index of a hard copy encyclopedia. An encyclopedia's index is an alphabetical list of major words and concepts with references to specific books and the pages on which a word or concept is located. ZyINDEX goes one step further: it records the position of all the words so that you can contextually search for any word or combination of words and sort the results in order of relevance, a concept called 'full-text search'.
  </p>
        <h3>Creating Archives</h3>
        <p>ZyINDEX creates and manages archives that contain all your scanned paper documents and electronic files. Just point to a location (folder) in your network and ZyINDEX will index all the electronic files in this location. ZyINDEX supports over 700 different electronic file formats, such as Microsoft® Word, Microsoft® Excel, Microsoft® PowerPoint®, Adobe® PDF, Microsoft® Outlook PST files. ZyINDEX can create as many archives as you need for your company and each index can contain millions of scanned pages or Gigabytes/Terabytes of electronic information. With the ZyFIND search program, you are able to search all the indexed documents.
  </p>
        <h3>Additional Functionality</h3>
        <p>ZyINDEX can automatically update your index with new and changed documents. With the archiving function, information selected on the scanning date or the manual indexes can be deleted or moved to other archives. Information in the searchable archives can be published to any media type (CD-ROM, DVD, ZIP and more) so that you can easily transport, archive, copy or distribute information. One CD-ROM can hold up to 15,000 scanned pages plus the free ZyLAB search engine (non-commercial only).

        <p> NTFS security can be set on indexes and documents through the file system. The optional Security Module goes one step further and allows you to set NTFS security through the ZyINDEX interface and set security on specific documents based on the manual indexes and the functionality of the ZyLAB programs.
