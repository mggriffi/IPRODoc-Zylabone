        <p>Before security can be set, users have to be added to a user database. This database is located at \\ZyLAB Data\Users. User groups will be defined in the groups database, and in the group profiles database will be defined in which NT groups a certain user is located. After a fresh installation these databases are empty and can be filled with the Security tab in ZyINDEX. Underneath the Security tab folders can be found in which the users/groups can be imported, created and the identities of the users can be defined. </p>
        <p>Default user roles are created, which can be used or adjusted to fit your needs. </p>
        <p>During installation you can choose between five types of security:</p>
        <p>No ZyLAB Security: standard network access only</p>
        <p>Advanced Server: Import user (groups) from the NT domain<br />An anonymous user account enables you to access the databases and add your own user (groups).</p>
        <p>Advanced Server: Enter your own user (groups)</p>
        <p>Advanced Client: Use existing database (NT domain)</p>
        <p>Advanced Client: Use existing database (own user groups)</p>
        <p>The first option does not install security. If you are no Domain Administrator, you choose for Advanced Server: Import user (groups) from the NT domain. The 4th and 5th option both assume a working security database is in place.</p>
