        <h2 id="h2_293919570" data-has-heading-anchor="true">File System (Network) Security</h2>
        <p>File System or Standard NTFS (Windows New Technology File System) Security provides performance, security, reliability, and other advanced features, such as file and folder permissions, encryption, disk quotas, and compression. <br />ZyLAB NTFS Security can be given on general folders of ZyLAB (installation directory, indexes directory, index data directory, etc.) and the different folders of the index. NTFS rights are set on the actual files of the archive, or the data, or the program. This is normally done when setting up the program, and this is a task for an administrator. NTFS rights are irreversible, so make sure that you do not exclude yourself from the list. Always make sure that the Administrators group has full control.<br /></p>
        <p>The NTFS security module enables you to create an index that leaves the results a user is not authorized to see out of the result list. The references of the documents that are shown in the result list are only the references to the documents that the user is allowed to see. When you set normal NTFS security (without using the module) on folders containing documents or document groups, you will see the results you are not allowed to open appear in the result list. If you double click such a reference the program will tell you that the document can not be opened.</p>
        <p>In order to set NTFS Security, create a NTFS Security index. The locations (folders and subfolders) where the data is stored, can be secured with the help of the module.</p>
        <p>If you build an index and set security on the data folders over which the index is built, you will still be able to search on the full-text of all the documents that are in the data folder. The reason for this is that the contents of all the documents are stored in the index and as long as you have access to that index you can search on every word that is in the index and hence know if the word(s) you are searching for are present. The only thing is that the documents cannot be opened when you select a reference, or do not even appear in the result list (if you use the NTFS Security Module).</p>
        <p>Once you have created a NTFS Security index, you can assign NTFS rights to user groups. You can enable user rights on for instance the wwwroot (where web clients are called from). This enables you to set rights for groups to access the entire website. It is not intended for setting rights to individual web clients. It is best to let an administrator first design a security plan, and then enforce it. That limits the chance that you get locked out. As stated earlier; setting NTFS rights is usually irreversible.</p>
        <p>NTFS rights with custom groups can only be set if you have chosen NTFS rights during installation, or when the appropriate groups have been created on the domain. NTFS group rights settings exist on the basis of user groups on the local domain, or machine. If you have not created user groups on the domain, you will only see default domain user groups, not the ZyLAB user groups. Individual (imported) users will be seen by the NTFS security setting engine, because these can be led back to their original NT user account.</p>
        <p>You can set rights for specific indexes and data. This enables individual settings per index. Once again bear in mind that settings are basically irreversible, and limited to the installation type!</p>
