        <p>ZyALERT is an SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) module that may be used to automatically
 detect relevant information in huge archives. ZyALERT acts as an information agent which searches the data
 at set times based on user-defined profiles. The information found is then distributed by fax, e-mail, disk, or
 may be directed to a printer.
   </p>
        <p>Principally, ZyALERT automates the searching and the distribution of information via e-mail. Users can get
 information automatically delivered by subscribing to an index. Such a subscription is based on a
 subscription profile or alert and a time schedule specifying what information should be delivered and how
 frequently it should be delivered. The subscription profile is in fact a ZyLAB query that is repeatedly
 executed against all new and modified documents in an index.<br /></p>
        <p>  We can imagine that you are not entirely familiar with the concepts of SDI (Selective Dissemination of
 Information) or other subjects concerning information retrieval. Therefore, we have added this section on
 information retrieval and filtering.
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Filtering Information</h3>
        <p>
  With the increasing availability of information in electronic form, it becomes more important and feasible
 to have automatic methods to filter information. Most organizations generate large amounts of
 information, which can include incoming faxes and letters, departmental and technical memoranda,
 announcements of meetings and conferences, and minutes of meetings. This volume of information makes
 it difficult to keep employees apprised of all relevant documents.<br /></p>
        <p>  If you are part of an organization that has a lot of different interests, only a small fraction of the available
 information will actually be relevant to you and this information probably differs from information that
 your colleagues are interested in. The supervisor will have to address the problem and determine what
 information is of interest to any employee, while minimizing the amount of searching through irrelevant
 information.<br /></p>
        <p> People need to decide what information is important to them and, hence, they are constantly filtering the
 information they are exposed to. Most people read a paper by scanning the headlines to see which articles
 are of interest. In this way you filter out some of the large amount of information to which you have access.
 With more and more documents presented to us in digital form, part of the filtering can be handled by a
 system that presents the information. ZyALERT is such a system. It can filter all digital information and show
 you only those documents that are of interest to you.<br /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p> Information filtering can work on behalf of the users as well as on behalf of the sources. For both of these
 cases you can use ZyALERT. In the first case, a filtering program assists users in finding relevant information.
 Users specify their information needs and define their profiles.<br /></p>
        <p> In the second case, filters can be used by sources to "target" information to potentially interested users.
 The source presents some descriptions of the information to the filter, and the filter forwards to the 
 
 individual users a subset of the items it selected based on advance knowledge stored as users' profiles or
 queries.<br />  In both cases users can have the option of providing the filter with feedback indicating the extent to which
 the selection met their current information needs. The feedback may be provided explicitly, through a
 feedback possibility towards the system administrator, or implicitly, by skipping over unwanted items.
 Especially after the installation of ZyALERT it is important that users provide the system administrator with
 feedback about the accuracy of the user profiles.
</p>
        <h3>Features of Filtering</h3>
        <p>The term filtering is used for a variety of processes involving the delivery of information to people who
 need it.</p>
        <p>An information filtering system is an information system designed for unstructured or semi-structured data.
 This means that you can use ZyALERT to filter most incoming information, not restricted by questions
 regarding format or style.<br /></p>
        <p> Information filtering deals primarily with textual information. ZyALERT searches the incoming text
 documents to see if they match with particular queries. However, it can also handle other types of data
 such as images and video that are part of multimedia information systems.</p>
        <p>Filtering systems can easily deal with large amounts of data. ZyALERT is only limited by the storage capacity
 of your system. Filtering applications typically involve flows of incoming data, either being broadcast by
 remote sources like newswire services, or sent directly by local sources like mail.</p>
        <p>Filtering is based on descriptions of individual or group information preferences called profiles. Usually the
 system administrator will define the profiles and distribute them among users. As a result a user will only
 receive information that is of interest to him or that he should be aware of.</p>
        <p>Filtering is meant to imply the removal of data from an incoming flow, rather than finding data in that flow.
 Users therefore see what is left after obsolete data is removed, whereas in text retrieval systems they see
 the data that is extracted. The system administrator can e.g. specify the removal of incoming "junk" electronic mail or faxes. Note that this means that profiles may not only express what people want, but also
 what they do not want.
</p>
        <h3>Notes concerning Profiles</h3>
        <p>Information filtering begins with users, who have relatively stable, long-term goals. Additionally, you can
 define profiles that display short-term goals. The description of what information is of interest and needs to
 be retrieved is called the user profile.<br /></p>
        <p> Groups as well as individuals have to be kept informed about certain topics. Such information interests lead
 users to engage in relatively passive forms of information-seeking behavior, such as having texts brought to
 their attention. In ZyALERT this is accomplished by representation of the information interests as profiles, in
 other words queries, which can be put to the filtering system.<br /></p>
        <p> To ensure delivery of proper information to the users, it is important that the system administrator has a
 good overview of what information is needed, and which users have to be kept informed about what
 topics. Profiles must reflect the current information interests and needs. Acquiring accurate descriptions of
 information needs is essential in a retrieval system, and also in a filtering system. <br /></p>
        <p> 
  The system administrator who is responsible for defining profiles should discuss information needs with the
 users before defining the profiles. It is important to realize that some words can have more than one
 meaning (e.g., the word bank) and that the same concept can be described by various words. The goal is to
 develop a query that filters the information that a user wants, represents his interests without a lot of
 overhead, and does not leave important information out.</p>
        <p>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p> As you are becoming more acquainted with all aspects of ZyALERT, you will get insight in what can be seen
 as a good query and what query will deliver unimportant or even wrong feedback. The only way this can be
 accomplished is by setting up an extensive discussion with end users, thus ensuring that the system
 administrator is kept informed about the value of the retrieved and distributed information and can change
 profiles and flows if necessary.
</p>
        <h3>Questions regarding Security</h3>
        <p>The ability to personalize the delivery of information depends on the availability of personal information
 about the users and their needs and wants. Since a significant portion of the users may be concerned with
 privacy questions, protection of privacy was an important consideration during the development of
 ZyALERT.<br />  We can distinguish three levels of privacy concerns: protection of user profiles and queries, protection of
 usage history and protection of the actual information if the delivery takes place over networks. The third
 concern may be shared by the information sources as well, since it is in the best interest of information
 providers that the information is delivered exclusively to users who are legal subscribers. These privacy
 concerns may also be addressed by the introduction of various levels of encryption on the communication
 lines.</p>
        <p>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p> Access rights are controlled by the constraints of the network that you are using. If you are a network
 administrator and you are installing ZyALERT on a network, keep in mind that all users who have read and
 write access to this directory can use ZyALERT to make changes to profiles and flows. We recommend that
 you install ZyALERT in a directory where all users rights are limited to read-only, to avoid users making
 changes.<br /></p>
        <p> If privacy concerns have a high priority you can also decide to install ZyALERT Index Server and Set-up in a
 directory where only the system administrator has access. This means that no one will be able to change or
 even view the contents of the Set-up and the Index Server except the system administrator.
</p>
        <h3>The Process of Filtering</h3>
        <p>Incoming data, such as faxes, news lines, mail, etc. must be brought to the users' attention. To accomplish
 this, texts are filtered and then distributed among users (being retrieved). These texts are read (or not) and
 are evaluated in terms of how well they respond to the information needs and interests. The evaluation
 may lead to modification of the profiles and information interests. The modified profiles are used in
 subsequent comparison processes.<br /></p>
        <p> Information filters must examine information items or some description of them before it can be decided
 whether they are relevant for any given user. The success of a filtering program such as ZyALERT is very
 strongly affected by the types of descriptions of the information that is available. Since, in general,
 administrators are not and cannot be familiar with all incoming information items that are being filtered; 
 
 you will have to develop queries that are "broad" enough to handle all types of incoming information and
 "narrow" enough to give users exactly the information that they search for.<br /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p> In ZyALERT each profile is a query. As soon as you connect a profile to a flow, all incoming data is compared
 with the query that is specified in the profile. After comparison, ZyALERT will decide whether or not this
 information is relevant and distribute it to users. At this point the program uses the retrieval techniques of
 ZyINDEX.<br /></p>
        <p> You can find extensive information regarding text retrieval and the definition of queries in the Standard
 User Manual.
</p>
        <h3>Automatic Notification of Search Query Results with ZyALERT</h3>
        <p>ZyALERT and ZyWEBSERVER are integrated closely. You can now send out an Alert message, which is linked
 to files in the ZyLAB Webserver.</p>
        <p>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p> When applied in the business environment, ZyALERT offers many advantages for applications such as
 personnel recruiting, business intelligence, media clipping services, and many other applications where
 timely and automatic notification of important documents results in higher productivity.<br /></p>
        <p> ZyALERT is easy to set up and administer. Any number of “ALERTS” can be set up to apply predefined
 queries that monitor selected indexes (document collections) at specified intervals. The system can be set
 to automatically deliver a notification (ZyRESULTS) or it can be set to e-mail the entire document to the
 user. It can even be set to output results from various ALERTs to different disk directories from where other
 external processes may be applied.<br /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>  ZyALERT uses e-mail for routing and delivery and doesn’t require the recipient to have any special viewing
 software. It is an excellent tool for filtering unstructured correspondence in order to generate input for a
 structured ERP or Workflow system. Since it can sort documents based on content, the most appropriate
 form of output can be applied for the specific document type, leveraging the value of your corporate
 intranet, e-mail or a ZyLAB Web Server.</p>
        <p>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p> A common application is for filtering customer correspondence and sorting it by categories like
 “complaints”, “product information requests”, “credit applications”, or any other category that can be
 identified by content analysis. Once sorted, a variety of dissemination tools can be used to deliver timely
 information by the most effective method.</p>
        <p>By automating the delivery of relevant information (Push technology), ZyALERT significantly increases the
 use of electronic information beyond what is typically possible with Pull technology. Users don’t have to
 remember to routinely search the system every day in order to find important information. Instead, they
 simply check their e-mail.</p>
        <p>Since version 5.0 it is possible to change your alerts via the ZyLAB webserver. So in case your interests are
 changing you have the possibility to change the search query online. A link on the bottom of the result list
 that is sent to you directs you to the subscription pages. </p>
        <h3>Scenarios with ZyALERT</h3>
        <p>There are many methods of using ZyALERT, depending on your company and what, where, when and how
 you want the information to be filtered. Some example scenarios are listed below:
</p>
        <p>  <ul class="bodytext"><li>Mr. Blob is an insurance consultant, you are interested in everything he is reporting; the incoming data
 is filtered, and the Alert is for all files relating to Mr. Blob. The found data is distributed and the data is
 left in the same condition.<br />  The data can also be sent to more than one directory if for example you wish to share Mr. Blob’s
 information with your accounting department.</li><li>Mr. Stork owns a hotel. He wants a list of all the guests in his hotel filtered to him daily, but guest list
 that are 24 hours old he would like deleted so as not to confuse himself or his staff. He will use the
 function Clean-up so that these files will automatically be deleted after 24 hours.</li><li>Data is coming into small data repository, Alerts on data, if a file is found, data is moved to archive
 depository. Catch Alerts is used to distribute data that is not distributed based on Full Text Retrieval.
 After distribute, all data is moved to an archive. Data can be distributed from the first repository only
 once. Alerts running on Archive can be sent to more then one user.</li><li>Mr. Roy and Mr. Krazt are owners of a shoe business. They want all information filtered which is related
 to Mr. Dunn, who is there wholesaler. Mr. Right wants to receive information only related to ‘New
 Orders’ and Mr. Left wants to receive information about ‘delivery dates’. This is possible by using the
 Catch-alerts function again and this time have the files distributed to different directories.</li></ul></p>
        <p>
  The data is arriving into a small repository, Alerts on data, if the files are found; data is moved to different
 directories. This is known as a topic analyzer.
