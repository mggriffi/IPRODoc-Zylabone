        </p>
        <p>ZySCAN is a powerful tool that easily processes paper documents and existing image formats into
 searchable information.

</p>
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>
  ZySCAN can drive both high-end and low-end scanners so that all your paper documents can be scanned in
 any size, whether it is A0, A4, A5, letter or legal. If you already have your documents in an image format
 such as TIFF, JPEG or Fax, ZySCAN can import and process these files as well.

</p>
        <h3>Automatic Indexing</h3>
        <p>ZySCAN recognizes all the text in documents, regardless of the size, and uses this recognized text to index
 all of a document’s information automatically. You can be sure that all of this information is processed
 because ZySCAN’s different OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engines provide the most accurate and
 thorough results possible. The OCR process also supports multiple languages, such as Arabic and English, on
 the same page. Even rotated text is recognized.

</p>
        <h3>Manual Indexing</h3>
        <p>If required, ZySCAN enables you to add manual index fields to the scanned or imported documents. A
 variety of different field types is possible, such as Plain Text, Date, List, Barcode and many others. These
 manual indexes can be filled automatically with a date, the number of pages, the language of the document
 and so on. Whatever information you need indexed, and depending on whether you want to have that
 information manually or automatically indexed, ZySCAN gives you the flexibility to manage the information
 in your documents in any way you see fit. The ZyLAB search programs enable you to search for all the
 words that are indexed, which ensures that you are able to retrieve your documents again.</p>
        <h3>Information Storage</h3>
        <p>ZySCAN uses an open file format to store all information. This format is XML or ASCII text for the manual
 and automatic index information and open-source TIFF for the original scanned or imported documents.
 The TIFF image guarantees a 100% copy of the original file, retaining all information such as signatures and
 written remarks. XML is a non-proprietary format for information storage and exchange. On average, 1 GB
 can store about 15,000 A4 pages (B/W).

</p>
        <h3>Production Environment</h3>
        <p>ZySCAN is a very scalable solution and is therefore suited for high volume scanning and processing. Multiple
 ZySCAN clients can be set up and the whole process of scanning and manual and automatic indexing can be
 divided over different PCs to create a reliable high-volume scanning environment.</p>
