        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Conditions</h4>
        <p>You can reactivate a Web Client which has had its entry in the Windows registry removed (for example, moved to another computer), but whose physical files were kept, or when ZyINDEX was removed and reinstalled. ZyINDEX &gt; Web Client is open. You cannot reactivate a deleted Web Client.</p>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Instructions</h4>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Go to File &gt; Open.</li>
            <li>Browse to the Web Client configuration file. This is a file with extension *.ZyC and it should be located in a directory called "Config" or "HTML" somewhere within the HTTP root directory. For example, C:\inetpub\wwwroot\demo\html</li>
            <li>Select the *.ZyC file.</li>
            <li>Click Open.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Result</h4>
