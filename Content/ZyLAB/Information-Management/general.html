        <p>Before security can be set, users have to be added to a user database. This database is located at ~\Program Files\ZyLAB\Information Management Platform\Users. User groups will be defined in the groups database, and in the group profiles database will be defined in which NT groups a certain user is located. After a fresh installation these databases are empty and can be filled with the Security tab in ZyINDEX. Underneath the Security tab folders can be found in which the users/groups can be imported, created and the identities of the users can be defined. </p>
        <p>Default user roles are created, which can be used or adjusted to fit your needs. </p>
        <p>During installation you can choose between five types of security:</p>
        <p>No ZyLAB Security: standard network access only</p>
        <p>Advanced Server: Import user (groups) from the NT domain<br />An anonymous user account enables you to access the databases and add your own user (groups).</p>
        <p>Advanced Server: Enter your own user (groups)</p>
        <p>Advanced Client: Use existing database (NT domain)</p>
        <p>Advanced Client: Use existing database (own user groups)</p>
        <p>The first option does not install security. If you are no Domain Administrator, you choose for Advanced Server: Import user (groups) from the NT domain. The 4th and 5th option both assume a working security database is in place.</p>

        <p>ZyNETLogin enables you to authenticate users by using integrated or basic clear text authentication. This will allow you to import Windows NT users, without manually adding (new) passwords to the ZyLAB User tables, while still keeping a firm security policy in place. If a user is authenticated, then ZyNETLogin generates a cookie using the random password that was generated for the user when the account was imported. This cookie and a login page is submitted to the client which can then automatically logon to the Web Client. The webserver zynet.exe is running in anonymous mode as a user that has full permissions to access the indexes and data.</p>
        <p>ZyNETLogin gets you authenticated on the domain, takes your username, searches the name in the User table, and gets the password you have in ZyINDEX. It encodes the password and username in the cookie and hands over the cookie. Then it goes to the default login page for automatic login. As you see it does not matter what password you use for the user.</p>

			Note</h4>
        <p>If ZyNET or ZyNETlogin (advanced security) is running in integrated authentication mode in IIS, users that are members from imported LDAP groups are not automatically imported in ZyLAB security based on their group membership when they perform an automatic login action to access a WebClient (This information applies to: ZyINDEX Security, Version V5.0 SP4c).</p>

        <h3 id="h3_320418512" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Automatic user import from LDAP groups</h3>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Problem</h4>
        <p>Users in groups imported from an active directory using WinNT or LDAP are not authenticated at logon. </p>
        <p>When an active directory group is imported in ZyLAB security users, that group is not authenticated and added to the ZyLAB security user database. <br /></p>
        <p>When a LDAP group is imported a member of this group that is logged on as the current logged is not authenticated by ZyLAB security. <br />If the ‘Automatic logon’ setting is active in ZyLAB security (General/Settings) users in LDAP groups should be automatically imported in the ZyLAB security users database from the LDAP group directory when logging on to a WebClient (Automatic login) or starting a ZyLAB windows application. <br /></p>
        <p>This is not happening, users are not imported and thereby authenticated as an anonymous user account that can result in denied access permissions.</p>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Solution</h4>
        <p>If you want to setup import from active directory, you have to complete the "activedirectory" attribute (marked with green). If it appears you can automatically import or refresh a user when logging in using 'basic clear text' authentication but not when using 'integrated windows' authentication, then probably you have to configure a special user and password which has rights to access the active directory (marked blue).</p>

			How to configure ZyLAB LDAP integration to import users and LDAP groups from an active directory to support users to be automatically imported from imported LDAP groups on logon.</p>
        <p>When a LDAP group is imported, a member of this group who is logged on as the current logged can be authenticated by ZyLAB security. In case the ‘Automatic NT Import’ setting is active in ZyINDEX Security &gt; General &gt; Settings, users in LDAP groups can be automatically imported in the ZyLAB security users database from the LDAP group directory when logging on to a WebClient (Automatic login) or starting a ZyLAB windows application.<br /></p>
        <p>To do so you must specify the active directory domain name you want to connect to in the settings.xml file, which can be found in the ZyLAB\Users folder.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Go to the ‘Domains’ section, which is the first configurable section in the settings.xml:<br /><br />Example:<br />&lt;settings id="Domains" activedirectory="LDAP://domainname/DC=domain name,DC=domain extention"&gt;</li>
            <li>Add in the ‘domain name’ section the name of the domain you want to connect to.<br />This is the domain name without the domain extension. </li>
            <li>In order to retrieve active directory information you need to query the domain, to do so you must specify the separate domain components (DC’s) in the LDAP connection path. <br />(There are freeware tool available to retrieve LDAP paths (DC’s etcetera) and many more LDAP compliant properties from the active directory.)<br />A domain can consist of multiple DC’s for example SAMPLEDOMAIN and WAN these are two domain components in the full domain name: ‘sampledomain.wan’.<br />Add the DC strings next to the domain name separated by commas in the “Domains” section.<br /><br />Example: <br />&lt;settings id="Domains"activedirectory="LDAP://sampledomain/DC= sampledomain,DC=wan "&gt;</li>
            <li>Leave the WinNT string as it is, it is not required to configure a WinNT import source when you are using LDAP import.<br /><br />Example: <br />&lt;source id="WinNT://SAMPLEDOMAIN"&gt;SAMPLEDOMAIN&lt;/source&gt; </li>
            <li>To connect to an organizational unit in the active directory in order to retrieve the actual users accounts/groups it contains you need to query the LDAP domain with the /OU argument (organizational unit).<br />In order to do so you need to specify the organizational unit to be queried (for example the organizational unit in England: SAMPLEDOMAINUK) followed by the domain components that have to be specified in separate domain component strings DC’s.<br />It is possible to retrieve more than one organizational unit from a LDAP source.</li>
            <li>Add the OU connection strings in the ‘Active Directory|Organizational Units’ section:<br /><br />Example: <br />- &lt;settings id="Active Directory|Organizational Units"&gt;&lt;source id="LDAP://SAMPLEDOMAIN/OU=SAMPLEDOMAINUK,DC=SAMPLEDOMAIN,DC=WAN"&gt;England&lt;/source&gt;<br />&lt;/settings&gt;<br /><br />(Between the angle quotation marks you can find the name that is displayed in the organizational unit selection list in ZyLAB security for example ‘England’.)</li>
            <li>In case required you can authenticate to the LDAP directory by specifying your users name and password.<br />Add this authentication line as the first line in the ‘Active Directory|Organizational Units’ section:<br /><br />Example: <br />&lt;source id="LDAP://SAMPLEDOMAIN" username="SAMPLEDOMAIN\JOHN" password="mypassword"/&gt;</li>

			Note</h4>
        <p>If ZyNET or ZyNETlogin (advanced security) is running in integrated authentication mode in IIS, users that are members from imported LDAP groups are not automatically imported in ZyLAB security based on their group membership when they perform an automatic login action to access a WebClient (This information applies to: ZyINDEX Security, Version V5.0 SP4c).</p>

        <h3 id="h3_1903653120" data-has-heading-anchor="true">About Audit Trail</h3>
        <p>The Audit Trail module stores in an XML file all user activities such as searching, viewing and editing documents and opening, deleting and building indexes. Every user action performed on the audited index creates XML files containing information on the action, the user, etc. You can select the activities you want to store in the XML file. With ZyLAB you are able to index and search all these XML files and view the activities the users have performed.</p>
        <p>Once a user (administrator) enables Audit Trail in ZyINDEX, all user actions performed on the chosen index will be logged (when selected) by the Audit trail, including ZyFIND, ZyINDEX and ZySCAN actions. By default, the module audits 43 actions, but an administrator can enable or disable individual Audit trail actions. </p>
        <p>Audit trail generates a new XML document for every selected Audit action performed by a user to store the log data. These XML files are stored (by default) in folders in the directory ~\\ZyLAB Data\Index Data\&lt;&lt;short name&gt;&gt;\XML by a Hash Table system to minimize the retrieval time. This means that ZyINDEX in the beginning will create a new folder for every new XML document and starts filling the folders afterwards. </p>
        <p>As mentioned, every selected Audit action that a user performs will generate an XML document containing the logged information. The name of the XML file is a GUID (Global Unique ID). All extra information about the XML file is stored in a database. This database can be found in the index directory (\\ZyLAB Data\Indexes\&lt;&lt;short name&gt;&gt;\ZxpPlugins\audit) and is called AUDIT.dbf. Much information is logged in this database and are linked with the XML files due to the GUID. Some examples are: User, Computer name, date and time, index name, file name, Guid, Application. For more information about the data that can be logged, see Retrieve Audit Trail data (page <a href="general.html#O_3467">193</a>).</p>

        <p>The easiest way to retrieve this log information is to press <img src="../../Storage/zylab-information-management-publication/general-img0014.png" width="51" height="46" alt="" /> in the vertical icon bar of ZyFIND.</p>
        <p>Obviously, you can also perform full-text search queries on the Audit Trail index. Any other feature that is available for regular indexes is also supported for Audit Trail indexes. For information about the Field viewer, see Indirect (Field) Search: Retrieve Documents (page <a href="general.html#O_3468">197</a>).</p>

        <h3 id="h3__310064985" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Indirect (Field) Search: Retrieve Documents</h3>
        <p>When the audit trail index is selected in ZyFIND, it is possible to search on the fields of the audit index. If you want to see the actual documents users viewed, it is possible to do an indirect search. An indirect search means that you search for every document that has been, for example, viewed and see the actual results instead of the XML files containing the name of the viewed document. Now you can see the viewed documents yourself, read the information and export or copy them. </p>
        <p>For indirect searching you need to select not only the Audit Trail index, but also the index that contains the documents you want to view. Also, the option ‘Search Documents’ and 'With Audits' has to be enabled to do such a search (these options are available when the Audit index is selected):</p>

        <h3 id="h3__1349622242" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Suppress job in Audit Trail</h3>
        <p>It is possible to log all actions of ZySCAN which are defined in an Audit Trail index, therefore it is possible to see exactly who, and on which day, and at what time, opened a job, closed a job, deleted a job, created a new job, created a new job template, created a new text (txt/XML) file, created a new image (TIFF) file, exported an image (TIFF) file and edited fields.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Storage/zylab-information-management-publication/general-img0016.png" width="460" height="423" alt="" class="Thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <p>If you want to prevent that actions performed during a job in ZySCAN are logged, select 'Suppress job in Audit Trail' when creating a job template. Using this template when processing a job deactivates the Audit Trail in ZySCAN.</p>
        <p>If you are running a large number of jobs, it may be convenient to turn the Audit Trail off. It will prevent the accumulation of large quantities of data, which could potentially slow down system performance. </p>
