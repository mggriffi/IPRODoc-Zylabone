  ZyFIND is a powerful and robust program that allows you to search, find and organize all documents that are in your ZyLAB archives. 
  </p>
        <h3 id="h3_656259478" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Search</h3>
        <p>
  
  
  With ZyFIND, you can perform detailed searches for your documents. Because all documents are full-text indexed by ZyINDEX, you can search for any word or combination of words. ZyFIND supports all search techniques that are also available in the search engines that you find on the Internet. After your search, a result list displays the documents sorted by relevance. 
  <br /></p>
        <h3 id="h3_1891435765" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Find </h3>
        <p>

  
  A big difference exists between searching and finding. ZyFIND provides a unique feature—called “hit highlighting”—that helps you find the information you looked for, immediately. Hit highlighting marks the words you where looking for in the original scanned or electronic document. You can see right away if this document is the one you are looking for. ZyFIND enables you go directly to the page where the hit appears, which saves you time, especially if your hit is on the last page of a lengthy document. 
  <br /></p>
        <h3 id="h3__342684933" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Organize </h3>
        <p>
  After you have found the information you are looking for, you can start organizing your data. Of course, ZyLAB offers organizing capabilities at the point of input, but in many cases, you’ll want to organize on the fly. Therefore, ZyLAB offers different techniques to label, structure and organize your data at different times. You can manually change or add additional indexes (key fields) to the document or add a hierarchical structure to your documents. With this flexibility, you are better able to find a particular document the next time you open your ZyLAB archive. All of your colleagues will also be able to use the structure you added to the documents. 
  <br /></p>
        <h3 id="h3__1361679894" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Analyze </h3>
        <p>

  Using ZyView in combination with ZyLAB Analytics Server lets you run on-the-fly analysis of the found document, including data extraction and translation (depends on the Job Definition and Job Profile setup in Analytics Server). 
  <br /></p>
        <h3>Distribute</h3>
        <p>

  After you find the document you are looking for, you can view it or send it by email, print the document, or export the document to another archive or even another application.
