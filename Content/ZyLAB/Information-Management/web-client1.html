        <p>The ZyLAB Web Client uses ZyLAB scanning and full-text retrieval technology to provide transparent Internet or intranet access to scanned and indexed information. You can access the ZyLAB Web Client with any Internet browser and search for documents that contain the information you are looking for.</p>
        <p>In ZyLAB Web Client, you can organize, group, print, upload and download documents from multiple indexes using all the features that make ZyFIND so powerful.</p>
        <p>Using the ZyLAB Web Client, you can easily share information throughout your company even if you have offices in different locations. All you have to do is start your Internet browser and access the URL of your archive. The intuitive and fully customizable interface allows you and your colleagues to find what you are looking for.</p>
        <p>A ZyLAB Web Client contains various HTML pages. We will discuss the Default HTML web pages that are used when creating a Web Client. The Default template includes all module options and KWIC view (see ZyLAB Web Client for Users). Once a module index is added to the Web Client in ZyINDEX, those options become available.</p>
        <p>The HTML pages of the Web Client are easy to change so they can be adapted to your in-house style (however, the functionality of ZyLAB Web Client itself cannot be changed).</p>
        <p>We will provide information about creating and configuring a Web Client in ZyINDEX, and further configuration of the Web Client in an internet browser. For User instructions refer to ZyLAB Web Client for Users, which is included with created Web Clients.</p>
