            <li>Disable caching in browser<br />When caching is enabled, ZyNET will send a new version only if documents/images have been changed, otherwise stored (cached) content will be used. It is recommended to disable caching when using Annotations. For more information, see Disable Caching (page <a href="create-and-edit-a-web-client.html#O_4667">133</a>).</li>

			Conditions</h4>
        <p>You want to open ZyLAB Archives via Internet search engines such as Google, Yahoo, etc. In order to do so, a sitemap must be created. A sitemap is used by webmasters to inform search engines about pages on their sites that are available for crawling. Using the Sitemap protocol does not guarantee that web pages are included in search engines, but provides hints for web crawlers to do a better job of crawling your site.</p>
        <p>Documents need to be transformed to plain HTML for indexing by search engines. A special template (Search engine optimization) is created for that reason. To edit this template and optimize your web presence, go to the Templates section of a Web Client, and double click on the Search engine optimization template. All options of the template are explained clearly in the template. The template works for both electronic and scanned documents.</p>
        <p>Once ZyNET.exe detects a defined user agent (for example a web browser or search engine crawler), ZYNET.exe will display a special page that shows the HTML text version of a document.</p>

            <li>Open ZyINDEX &gt; Web Client.</li>
            <li>Select the Web Client that will be indexed by Internet search engines.</li>
            <li>Make sure one or more indexes are added to your Web Client.</li>
            <li>On the General page, click the Generate sitemap button to create a SiteMap XML file which informs search engines about pages that are available for crawling.<br />The SiteMap Generator dialog appears.</li>
            <p>Periodically refresh the SiteMap to make sure URLs of new documents are added.</p>

        </p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>In the Sitemap path field enter the location where the SiteMap XML file will be saved. If required use the Browse button select a location.</li>
            <p>Due to security issues, the SiteMap XML file must be placed in the root folder of the Web Client.</p>
            <li>Enter a name for the (to be created) SiteMap XML file in the Sitemap name field.</li>
            <p>Make sure you use a different Sitemap name for each Web Client that you want to be indexed by user agents. If you do not, older files with the same name will be overwritten.</p>
            <li>In the Internet Server URL field enter the external server on which the SiteMap XML file will run.</li>
            <li>To create a new SiteMap, select the checkbox Generate a new SiteMap. If you do not select this option, only new documents (URLs) will be added. </li>

            <p>The maximum size of a SiteMap is 50000 URLs or 10MB. The maximum size of a SiteMap index is 1000 SiteMaps. </p>
            <li>To provide user agents with information on the latest modification date of a file, select the checkbox Add last modified tag (uses file date).</li>
            <li>To define how frequently pages are likely to change, select the checkbox Add change frequency. This value provides general information to search engines and may not correlate to exactly how often they actually crawl the page. Choose from:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>always</li>
            <li>hourly</li>

            <li>yearly</li>
            <li>never</li>
            <p>The value 'always' should be used to describe documents that change each time they are accessed. The value 'never' should be used to describe archived URLs.<br /></p>
            <p>Please note that the value of this tag is considered a hint and not a command. Even though search engine crawlers may consider this information when making decisions, they may crawl pages marked 'hourly' less frequently than that, and they may crawl pages marked 'yearly' more frequently than that. Crawlers may periodically crawl pages marked 'never' so that they can handle unexpected changes to those pages.<br /></p>
            <p>Due to technical limitations the generated values are default values. These values can only be changed manually.</p>
        </ul>
        <ol start="12">
            <li>To define the priority of a URL relative to other URLs on your site, select the checkbox Add priority.</li>
            <p>Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0. This value does not affect how your pages are compared to pages on other sites - it only lets the search engines know which pages you deem most important for the crawlers.<br />The default priority of a page is 0.5.<br />Please note that the priority you assign to a page is not likely to influence the position of your URLs in a search engine's result pages. Search engines may use this information when selecting between URLs on the same site, so you can use this tag to increase the likelihood that your most important pages are present in a search index.<br />Also, please note that assigning a high priority to all of the URLs on your site will not guarantee that web pages are included in search engines. As the priority is relative, it is only used to select between URLs on your site.<br /></p>
            <p>Due to technical limitations the generated values are default values. These values can only be changed manually.</p>
            <li>To create the sitemap, click the Generate button.</li>

            <li>Open the SiteMap XML file(s), to check the contents.</li>
            <li>To define the user agents that are allowed to crawl your pages, go to Options &gt; Web Client.<br />The Web Site dialog appears.</li>

            <li>Click the Change button.</li>

        <p>If you want to view a template, select it, and click View. This will only work, if you defined a HTML browser via Options &gt; Web Client (see General options (page <a href="create-and-edit-a-web-client.html#O_3705">119</a>)).</p>

        <h3 id="h3_1284065784" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Edit Hit Markers</h3>
        <p>The hit markers appear each side of a hit and are used to jump to the previous or next hit: <img src="../../Storage/zylab-information-management-publication/create-and-edit-a-web-client-img0006.png" width="212" height="20" alt="" />. You can change the markers to your own preferred marker image by creating new images and replacing the original images.</p>
        <p>Note: Hit markers only appear in electronic documents and not in scanned documents.</p>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Instructions</h4>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>In the www root images folder for your web client ("\Inetpub\wwwroot\&lt;webclient&gt;\images") rename the PrevHit.gif and NextHit.gif files to "PrevHit.gif.orig" and "NextHit.gif.orig". </li>
            <p>Renaming the files allows you to revert to the original hit markers.</p>
            <li>Create new previous and next hit markers of a suitable size (the original hit markers are 14 x 9 pixels) in a graphics editor, for example Microsoft Paint.</li>
            <li>Save the new previous and next hit markers as .gif files in the www root images folder with the names "PrevHit.gif" and "NextHit.gif".</li>
            <li>Refresh your Web Client browser window. The new hit markers will now appear each side of a hit.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Result</h4>
        <p>You have changed the hit markers.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3 id="h3_973366405" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Added login via cookie</h3>
        <p>A cookie device is enabled to allow removal of the NT_User details from the URL. Also, your username and password are saved so you do not have to login each time.</p>

        <h3 id="h3_1386116633" data-has-heading-anchor="true">Disable Caching</h3>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Conditions</h4>
        <p>When caching is enabled, you can save bandwidth and reduce processing time when viewing documents and images on the web. ZyNET will send a new version only if documents/images have been changed, otherwise stored (cached) content will be used. Caching is enabled by default.</p>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Instructions</h4>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Go to ZyINDEX &gt; Web Client.</li>
            <li>Select the folder of an index.</li>
            <li>Select the option 'Disable Caching in browser'.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Result</h4>
        <p>Caching will be disabled.</p>
        <h4 data-has-heading-anchor="true">
			Note</h4>
        <p>It is recommended to disable caching when using Annotations. Changes to certain plugin fields are not shown when caching is enabled (this has to do with the fact that changes are not reflected in the modified date/time). </p>
        <p>Caching works for the following ZyNET actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li>ZyActionD (file display)</li>
                <li>ZyActionG (INSO inline image, and images with document-level security)</li>
                <li>ZyActionW (download/launch)</li>
                <li>ZyActionP (download as PDF)</li>
                <li>ZyActionM (view as TIFF)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>tiff2png (showing images as inline-PNG-images) also supports caching. Caching cannot be disabled, but tiff2png has no problems with plugin fields. </p>
