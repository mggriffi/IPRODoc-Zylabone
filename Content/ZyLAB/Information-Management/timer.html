			Scheduled Indexing</h4>
        <p>If you want to build the index(es) at specific times or intervals, you can schedule indexing. You can have different schedules for the respective functions Add, Quick build, Update and Optimize. This allows one to, for example, build the index hourly and to update and optimize it daily. <br />Also, any number of indexes can be scheduled. However, too many scheduled indexes and they will be skipped automatically, due to lack of time. The same holds for a frequency that is too high.</p>
        <p>You can either index at specific intervals, or automatically.</p>

			Service</h4>
        <p>It is also possible to run TIMER as a NT service. This means that you can shut ZyINDEX down and log off of the system, while the scheduled building of the index will continue. </p>
