        <p>ZyLAB Workflow enables you to thoroughly yet easily manage specific workflow processes and link documents from a ZyLAB archive to specific steps in a process. ZyLAB Workflow capabilities are ideally suited for handling all aspects of established procedures with little or no reconfiguration required of internal subtasks.</p>
        <p>A workflow process can be triggered by making a simple scan of a document, whether on a traditional scanner or a digital copier. Immediately, the document is archived and fully searchable in the ZyLAB archive, which allows easy retrieval of relevant information and starts a new workflow process. Users can be alerted that new tasks are pending or open their workflow inbox to see if new tasks need attention. A workflow process can also be initialized from an e-mail message or an electronic document, such as Microsoft® Word.</p>
        <p>In the new design, ZyLAB Workflow is able to address large volumes of data (&gt;100.000 workflows) with an outstanding performance. </p>
