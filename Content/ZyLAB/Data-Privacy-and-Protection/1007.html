        </h3>
        <p><span class="bodytext">Before reviewing the documents, Enron estimates how much time is needed to complete the DSAR and how many people are needed to complete this task. This is important, because companies have one calendar month to comply and deal with access requests.
<br /></span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">This step is essential to the process as it will ensure that your company is able to respond to a subject access request within one month. However, if it becomes evident in this step that a lot of work needs to be done and many documents need to be searched, the time limit to respond can be extended by a further two months due to complexity of the request.
<br /></span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">This estimation can easily be done by performing a quick search and observing how many documents are found. By searching the different variations of John Doe’s name, 114 documents are found. In the PTM_Address 1 column, many different addresses are shown. This indicates that these documents contain third party’s personal data, and these must be redacted before production. In a pivot table, it is possible to see how often a certain category of PI occurs.

        <p><span class="bodytext">By producing a report of the documents, Enron can estimate how long it takes to review and redact these documents. Once the report is downloaded, a pivot table can be created to get a better overview.<br /></span>

        <p><span class="bodytext">By double clicking on any of the custodian names, all the values are shown. This can give an indication of the time and personnel needed to deal with the DSAR.
