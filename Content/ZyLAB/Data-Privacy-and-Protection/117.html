        <p>
  After encountering a document with personal data and tagging it with the <b>Personal data</b> tag, and deciding that it is&#160;of importance to store this document without anonymizing or pseudonymizing it, you need a <b>Purpose</b><b> of processing</b>. The <b>Purpose of processing</b> is the legal ground on which the processing of personal data is based.

        </p>
        <p> In order to store documents with personal data inside, without having to anonymize the personal data, at least one of the legal requirements must be met. If at least one of the previous subtags is applicable in the situation, the documents with the personal data can be stored in accordance with the GDPR. However, if no legal ground is applicable, the documents cannot be stored without having to anonymize the personal data.
