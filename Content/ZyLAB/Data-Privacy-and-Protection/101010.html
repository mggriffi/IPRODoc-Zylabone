        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Receiving a Data Subject Access Request</h2>
        <p>
  John Doe has submitted a data subject access request (DSAR) to his former employer, Enron. In his request, John has asked for all his personal data that Enron has stored as per article 4(5) GDPR and the purposes of the processing.
<br /></p>
        <p>Upon receiving an access request, a company must first&#160;confirm whether or not they are processing personal data regarding the individual. Then&#160;they must provide a copy of the personal data that they are processing. As a last step,&#160;they need to provide information regarding the processing (such as the purposes of processing, the recipients and the categories of personal data processed).
<br /></p>
        <p>After Enron receives this request, they proceed to verify the identity of John Doe and determine whether his request is specific and clear. According to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office), a controller may ask the data subject to specify the information or processing activities that their request relates to, if it is not clear. The time limit to respond to the access request is then paused until clarification is received by the controller.
<br /></p>
        <p>Consequently, Enron’s legal department sends a link to John Doe to verify his identity and asks him to be more specific and to give a detailed overview of how he could be found in the system by for instance providing variations of his name, nickname(s), last name(s) etc.
</p>
        <p>John Doe has verified his identity and has sent the following list to clarify his request:</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Verify Identity</h2>
        <p>  
  The first step in responding to an access request is to verify the identity of the data subject. This is extremely important as any DSAR requested by an unauthorized person will result in a breach.
<br /></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there is no single correct way to verify the identity of a requester. This is up to your company and your procedures. It also matters who is making the request. If you do not already possess a copy of the passport or ID of the requester, then it would be disproportionate to ask for such a document to verify their identity. Asking for a copy of an ID or passport can also cause risks of identity theft and data breaches. You will then need to have extra security measures in place to protect such personal data.
<br /></p>
        <p>While responding to an access request, your company must still adhere to the GDPR’s overarching principles such as data minimization and confidentiality. You should therefore not retain new personal data, such as a copy of ID or passport, for the sole purpose of verifying the requester’s identity. The verification process must be proportionate, effective and efficient.
<br /></p>
        <p>Therefore, it would be better to choose a different method to verify the identity, such as verifying a link through email or providing their username and other relevant personal data.
  
  
  
 </p>
        <p><span class="note"><b>Example</b>:&#160;In order to verify John Doe’s identity, Enron sends a link to John through email which he can use to verify his identity.</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Determine Data Sources</h2>
        <p>  
  The time limit for responding to an access request begins once the data subject’s identity is verified and the request is clarified. Once it is established in which period John Doe worked for Enron and in which departments, it can be determined which data sources i.e., mailboxes and communications need to be uploaded to ZyLAB ONE and searched.
  
  </p>
        <p><span class="note"><b>Example</b>:&#160;Enron creates a list of all the managers involved in the departments where John Doe has worked and the projects he has worked on. In addition, they establish who the managers and employees were of the HR department in the period when John Doe worked for Enron. Once these names are listed, all their mailboxes and potentially hard disks from 1997-2002 can be collected and uploaded to ZyLAB ONE.</span>
