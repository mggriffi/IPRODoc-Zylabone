        <h1>Pseudonymizing</h1>
        <p>After tagging the document with a <b>Personal data</b> tag and deciding that it is of importance to store the document, 
it can be stored if there is a legal ground (Purpose) for the processing. If such legal ground is applicable, 
the data can be stored without having to edit the data in any way. However, in certain situations it may be useful to pseudonymize 
the data before storing it. <br /></p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">Pseudonymization of data is the ‘encryption’ of personal data, whereby the real personal data is replaced with a pseudonym. Pseudonymizing personal data can be useful if the user wishes that only authorized personnel can encrypt 
what the original personal data is behind the pseudonym. Authorized personnel can decode the pseudonym, by keeping a spreadsheet with 
all the pseudonyms and their original personal data. That way, if any member of the authorized personnel needs to find out what 
personal data is hidden behind the pseudonym, the person can search the pseudonym in the spreadsheet. <br /></span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">Pseudonymization can 
also be used for general data protection, like minimalizing the risk of exposing personal data during a data breach. 


Pseudonymization is an easy process when using ZyLAB ONE software, by using the Redaction and Auto Redaction features. </span>
