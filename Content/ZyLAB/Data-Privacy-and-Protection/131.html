        <h1>Produce Report</h1>
        <p><span class="bodytext">Instead of producing the documents directly, it is also possible to produce a report of the documents. 
 These reports contain information about the documents, such as where the document is located, 
 on which server it is located, the email ID associated with the document, and much more. 
 Producing reports is also of importance when it comes to deleting data in ZyLAB ONE. 
 Since not every user has been assigned with the same rights by the administrator, 
 it can be of use to report the documents that need to be deleted and then forward the report 
 to the authorized personnel that can delete the documents, like the IT department. 
   </span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">In order to produce a report, the user first has to select the desired documents that 
should be produced into a report. If the user wishes to report documents that should be later deleted 
by the authorized personnel, it is common to apply the <b>Potentially Removal Tag</b> to the documents that 
should be deleted. After applying the tag, 
the documents can then be found in the <b>Document List</b>&#160;page, 
by selecting the <b>Potentially Removal</b> tag beneath the search box and clicking <b>Search</b>. This action ensures that only documents that have been 
assigned with the <b>Potentially Removal</b> tag, will be shown in the <b>Document List</b>&#160;page.

        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">Now, the user can press the settings icon, and select the Reports option. 
Here the user can decide whether the report should be exported as an Excel or a CSV file. The user can also select 
the option whether or not the report should include information about the redactions inside the documents.

        <p><span class="bodytext">Next, the user can open the Excel or CSV file.
