        <h1>Anonymizing</h1>
        <p><span class="bodytext">After tagging a document with the <b>Personal data</b> tag and deciding that it is of importance to store the document, 
but there is no applicable legal ground (Purpose) for storing the document, it first needs to be anonymized. <br /></span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">Anonymizing personal data means removing the option for the data subject to be attributed to personal data, within a document. 
This can be easily done in&#160;ZyLAB ONE by using one of the&#160;two available options: Redaction or Auto-redaction. 
The difference between the two is one is performed manually, and the other is performed automatically by ZyLAB ONE.</span>
