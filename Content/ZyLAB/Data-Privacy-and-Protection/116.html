        <h1>Decide</h1>
        <p><span class="bodytext">After the appropriate tags have been assigned to the documents, you need to decide what you want to do with the data.&#160;<br /></span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">For instance, if a&#160;document set has the <b>Purpose</b> tag attached to it, it means that the documents have&#160;a purpose for processing and 
 can be stored in accordance with the GDPR. 
  <br /></span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">In this use case, we&#160;highlight&#160;three actions that&#160;ensure personal data is handled in accordance with the GDPR: 
  <br /></span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bodytext"><a href="117.html">Adding purpose and storing</a></span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bodytext"><a href="118.html">Anonymizing</a>&#160;
  <br /></span>
                </p>
                <p><span class="bodytext">Removing the option for the data subject to be attributed to personal data within a document. The data is irreversibly altered and it is impossible to detect if data relates to two, three or more people.&#160;The GDPR does not see it as personal data anymore. </span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="bodytext"><a href="121.html">Pseudonymizing</a><br /></span>
                </p>
                <p><span class="bodytext">Encrypting personal data by replacing the real personal data with a pseudonym.
The main difference is that pseudonymization is a reversible process, unlike anonymization. Also, the real person is identifiable with the proper key, which&#160;makes the data still valuable for an organization. However, this also&#160;means that the GDPR still sees pseudonymized data&#160;as personal data.</span>

        </ul>
        <p><span class="bodytext"><br /></span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">The choice between anonymization or pseudonymization depends&#160;on many factors (the use case, degree of risk, the way data is processed within your company, etc.).<br /></span>
