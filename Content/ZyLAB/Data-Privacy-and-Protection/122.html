        <h1>Redactions</h1>
        <p>Use&#160;the ZyLAB ONE redactions feature&#160;to easily protect sensitive, privileged or confidential data 
in accordance with the GDPR, by hiding personal data. The Redactions feature can be accessed after selecting a document, under the Redactions &amp;&#160;Annotations option. <br /></p>
        <p>		The Redaction Text&#160;option&#160;can be used to set the <b>pseudonym</b>.&#160;For example, if the user wants to pseudonymize the first and last name of a client, a black box can be placed above the name. Then, a pseudonym can be added by typing it in the Redaction Text option. This will result in the name being hidden by a black box with a pseudonym on top.<br /></p>
        <p>By clicking on the Appearance Settings, the appearance of the redaction box can be adjusted. This includes the color of the box, as well as the color of the font of the text that will appear in front of the box. All of these settings can be saved by checking the Save these settings as default option. By clicking Done, the selected field will be redacted using the customized settings.<br /></p>
        <p>Now the information about the redaction on the right side of the screen is updated with new information about who performed the redaction, as well as the time and date of the redaction.<br /></p>
        <p>The option to quickly redact can be useful when redacting multiple personal data on one page of the document. Select Quick Redact under Redact to be able to quickly redact multiple parts of a document. When all the personal data has been redacted, press Finish Redact. After this, the user can edit the previously made redactions. The user can edit the redactions separately, or edit them all at once by selecting the redaction and pressing Edit Selected.<br /></p>

        <h2 data-has-heading-anchor="true">Redact (R)</h2>
        <p>Redact (shortcut: R) to protect sensitive, privileged and confidential information by hiding selected content. 
			Specified sections are blacked out or replaced with something else; Text, for example. 
			Redactions can be accompanied with 'exemption codes' to identify the regulations under which the redaction is made. 
			The redacted document can be downloaded (as PDF), printed out or used electronically. 
			</p>
        <p>Native files cannot be redacted. Redacting native files changes their character, which is akin to spoliation. 
			</p>
        <p>Depending on the permissions you have received, you may not be able to add redactions.
