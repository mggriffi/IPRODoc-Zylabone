        <h1>Process with ZyLAB ONE</h1>
        <p>
  The process of handling personal data breaches with ZyLAB ONE is very much like the process of handling a data subject access request (DSAR). ZyLAB has an extensive instructional section&#160;regarding this process. Only four steps of this process are slightly different.
<br /></p>
        <p>Refer to the following link for the entire process—<a href="003-1.html">Data Subject Access Request</a><br /></p>
        <p>The four slightly different&#160;steps are outlined and explained in these topics:
</p>
        <p>
            <ul class="listbullet">
                <li class="listbullet"><a href="0505.html">Search</a>
                </li>
                <li class="listbullet"><a href="0506.html">Tag</a>
                </li>
                <li class="listbullet"><a href="0507.html">Redact</a>
                </li>
                <li class="listbullet"><a href="0508.html">Produce Documents</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>First,  due to the request from a data subject, the DSAR process starts. The organization then has a month to comply and respond to the request. However, in the case of a personal data breach, time is of the essence. Moreover, the search does not need to be as thorough and detailed as DSAR. What is important here is to estimate the categories of personal data that were affected by the breach, the categories of data subjects, and the approximate number of data subjects and their data involved.
<br /></p>
        <p>This process becomes much easier with ZyLAB. All you need to do is upload the data into ZyLAB ONE, search through the data, tag them, and produce a report. No redaction is necessary for these purposes.
