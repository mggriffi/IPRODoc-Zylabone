                <b>abbreviations and acronyms</b> &#160;An acronym is a pronounceable word formed from the initial letter or letters of major parts of a compound term. An abbreviation is usually formed in the same way but is not pronounced as a word. Abbreviations are often lowercase or a mix of lowercase and uppercase. Acronyms are almost always all caps, regardless of the capitalization style of the spelled-out form. 
</p>
            <p>
                <i>Abbreviation</i>: mph—for miles per hour; MB/s—for megabytes per second
</p>
            <p>
                <i>Acronym</i>: ROM—for read-only memory
</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
    When to spell out: Spell out an abbreviation or acronym on first occurrence in a chapter if you think your audience may not be familiar with it. In help documents, spell out the term when you introduce it. 
  </li>
                <li>
    How to spell out: When you spell out a term, generally put the spelled-out version first, with the abbreviation or acronym in parentheses. 
    <br /><br />    &#160;&#160;&#160;Internet service provider (ISP) 
    <br /><br />    If the abbreviation or acronym is much more familiar than the spelled-out version, you can put the abbreviation or acronym first, followed by the spelled-out version in parentheses, or you can explain that the abbreviation is “short for” the spelled-out version and place the spelled-out version in italics.
    <br /><br />    &#160;&#160;&#160;You can share your personal URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
    <br /><br />    An Internet address is sometimes called a URL, short for Uniform Resource Locator.
  </li>
                <li>
    File types: Use all caps for abbreviations of file types.
    <br /><br />    &#160;&#160;&#160;a JPEG file, an AIFF file, the MP3 file
    <br /><br />    Filename extensions, which indicate the file type, should be in lowercase.
    <br /><br />    &#160;&#160;&#160;.jpg, .aif, .mp3
  </li>
                <li>
    Punctuation: Don’t use periods except in abbreviations for customary (nonmetric) units of measure.
  </li>
                <li>
    Plural: Don’t add an apostrophe before the s when you form the plural of an abbreviation.
    <br /><br />    &#160;&#160;&#160;CDs, ICs, ISPs
  </li>
