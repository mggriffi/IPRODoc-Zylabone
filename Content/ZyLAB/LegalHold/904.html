                        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Messages are actions taken to preserve all relevant information by informing all custodians. While sending out emails can be seen as a proper form of action in preserving data, this is legally not the case. When&#160;a custodian does not respond, it is still the hold owner’s responsibility when&#160;data is lost. Therefore it is recommended to add questionnaires to the messages, which can be filled out by the custodians in the Custodian Portal. If the custodians accept the hold, this means that the responsibilities for any ESI’s lost is no longer with the litigative party.<![CDATA[
