        <h1>Image Settings</h1>
        <p>Step two of the production wizard. This is where you define&#160;if&#160;and&#160;how&#160;documents are produced as&#160;<a href="1510.html">images</a>.&#160;</p>
        <h3>
		How to start the Production Wizard:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>

		Produce</h2>
        <h3 data-has-heading-anchor="true">Produce as Images</h3>
        <ul class="BulletListBody">
            <li>
                <p data-has-heading-anchor="true"><b>All Documents</b>
                    <br />      All documents added to this production, will be produced as images.</p>
                <p data-has-heading-anchor="true"><b>+ Exceptions</b>: Selected&#160;file types will be produced as <a href="1511.html">natives</a>.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>No Documents</b>
                    <br />   No documents added to this production will be produced as images. However, there will be image <a href="1508.html">placeholders</a>. When selected, continue with<a href="1503.html"> Native Settings</a>. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Naming</h3>
        <p>Define how you want to name your images. The first three options are most commonly used.</p>
        <ul class="BulletListBody">
            <li>
                <p><b>Bates Number</b>
                    <br /><a href="1509.html">Bates Number</a> as defined in step 1 of the Production Wizard.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Bates Number + Extension</b>
                    <br />               The extension (file type) of each document will be added to the bates number.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Bates Number + Original Name + Extension</b>
                    <br />  The original name of the document will be placed between the bates number and the extension (file type).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Bates Number + Original Name + Extension</b>
                    <br />     The original name of the document will be placed between the bates number and the extension (file type).
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Bates Number + Confidentiality + Original Name + Extension</b>
                    <br />       If all images are confidential, you can add that to the naming.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Custom</b>
                    <br />      Alternatively, define your own naming convention. Add metadata (fields) from your matter.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Folder Properties</h3>
        <p>Define where you want to store your images.</p>
        <ul class="BulletListBody">
            <li>
                <p><b>Name</b>
                    <br />     The name of the folder in which the images will be saved.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Subfolder prefix</b>
                    <br />     The subfolder prefix will always be followed by a number.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Max documents</b>
                    <br />     Define the maximum number of documents allowed in a folder.
</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each image is one page of a document. The images of one document will never be split over two folders. The first document that is too large to fit in one folder, will be placed in its entirety in the next folder. If the document is still too large for this new folder, it will be placed in this folder nevertheless.</p>
        <p>You can select <b>Place files in root folder</b> to  place the files in the same root folder of the same file type. When enabled, the  images are not placed in subfolders, but in the same image folder. </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Image Settings</h3>
        <ul class="BulletListBody">
            <li>
                <p><b>Orientation</b>
                    <br />      
					Produce all images with the&#160;Portrait,&#160;Landscape or Auto-detect orientation.&#160;With Auto-detect, images can be produced based on the detected orientation of the original document.
                    Images are downscaled to fit (keeping the aspect ratio). They will never be cropped. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Output format</b>
                    <br />      Choose from Singlepage TIFF, Multipage TIFF, Searchable PDF and Searchable PDF (quality).
        <br />Each (Searchable PDF) profile has a different&#160;impact on the quality and performance of the OCR process used to create the searchable PDF. It will have no influence&#160;on the quality of images. It will mostly be noticeable with the text in files of an already lower quality.&#160; </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Singlepage TIFF</b>
                            <br />Creates a TIFF image consisting of 1 page.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Multipage TIFF</b>
                            <br />Creates a TIFF image consisting of 2 or more pages.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Searchable PDF</b>
                            <br />Creates a PDF file that can be searched.<br />Choose this option for fast performance, but slightly lower quality&#160;(mostly&#160;noticeable with the text in files of an already lower quality).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Searchable PDF (quality)</b>
                            <br />Creates a PDF that can be searched.<br />Use this option for high quality, but slower performance. Please note that this option is <i><b>not recommended</b></i> as the performance is considerably slower.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Accessible PDF </b>
                            <br />Creates a PDF that complies with the WCAG 2.1 depending on the lay-out and format of the original document. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.</p>
                        <p>Please note that due to the nature of ZyLAB ONE, ZyLAB ONE doesn't create any documents from scratch. Documents will be produced as is and if the original is formatted in a way that doesn't comply with the WCAG 2.1 standard, ZyLAB ONE will not change that. Examples of formatting that prevents document to be compliant with WCAG 2.1 are small font types or black text on a grey background that lowers the contrast.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Image size</b>
                    <br />     Choose from Letter (8.5x11.0 in/216x279 mm), A4 (8.3x11.7 in/210x297 mm), Legal (8.5x14.0 in/216x356 mm) or Auto (the original image size will be produced; this will overrule the Orientation setting).
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Resolution</b>
                    <br />   The lower the resolution, the less disk space you will need. However, the risk of data loss will increase. Choose from 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or 600 dpi.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Color settings</b>
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                    <p><b>Recommended Settings: </b>For black and white: 1 bit color and 300 dpi					For color: 24 bit color and 200 DPI.</p>
                    <p><b>Not Recommended</b>: 8 bit color and 8 bit greyscale. Use these option only for specific use cases.

</p>
                </div>
                <p>When data loss might be an issue, for example when converting from color to black and white, it is advised to produce color images. 
					However, be careful, because the resulting files will take up more space.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>+ Produce as Full Color</b>
                    <br />              If you selected 1 or 8 bit, you can produce - as an exception - a number of images in full color (24 bit).
              <br />             Select the file types you want to be produced as full color.
                    
        
          </p>
            </li>
            <li class="listbullet"><b>Units and Margin</b>
                <br />    The margin can be set in inches or centimeters.
 Fields are burned next to the image. If the margin is set too small, fields will be burned (partly) on top of the image.
          
        </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Compression</b>
                    <br />      You do not need to define the Compression, as it is related to the chosen color&#160;setting. It is displayed here for your convenience.
</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listbullet"><b>Remove blank pages</b>
                <br />  This option is often used for spreadsheets. As spreadsheets can be very large, they are often divided into several pages. Information may appear on only a few pages. The remaining blank pages can be removed.
 Sometimes it is not advised to remove blank pages, as this may in itself be important information. For example, someone might have deleted incriminating content.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Burn-In Fields</h2>
        <p>Burn-in fields (electronic stamping) cannot be removed and will always appear when the document is printed.     The image is shrunk slightly and the stamp is applied to a small margin on each page.
  </p>
        <h3>Burn-in Settings</h3>
        <p>     Type <b>[</b> or <b>Ctrl+space</b> to select a field.
</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Storage/zylab-one-manual-publication/burn-in.gif" alt="" class="Thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>Define the font family, font size, date format and the margin.      It is recommended to always define a small distance from the edge of the paper, so no information will be lost when the page is printed.
      </p>
        <h2>Redactions</h2>
        <h3>Include Redactions</h3>
        <p><a href="443.html">Redactions</a> are defined during the review process. During production, the redactions to the sensitive information can be included.</p>
        <h3>Redaction Appearance</h3>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>You can also make the colors transparent.</p>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hide Underlying Redactions when Page Redaction is Applied</h3>
        <p>When more than one redaction has been applied to the same area, you can choose whether the underlying redaction codes are visible when running a production.</p>
        <ul class="BulletListBody">

        <h3>Include Redaction Exemptions</h3>
        <p>     
Reviewers may have added reasons to explain why the information has been redacted/obscured, the redaction exemption reasons. 
These reasons can be added to the production and burned into the image.
      
      </p>

        <h3>Withhold Fully Redacted Pages</h3>
        <p>When enabled, fully redacted pages are not produced.	This prevents visual clutter and increase focus on pages containing information. When disabled, all fully redacted pages will be included in production.</p>
        <h3>Keep Original Bates Numbers for Withheld Pages</h3>
        <p>When enabled, withheld pages will keep the original bates numbers. Though this means that your production will contain gaps in the bates number range on the pages, the advantage is that you can rerun the production without withholding pages and still get the original bates numbers on your pages.</p>
        <h3>Select when to use Placeholders</h3>
        <ul class="BulletListBody">
            <li>

        <h3>Custom Placeholder Text</h3>
        <p>			Define the message that will be displayed inside the placeholder. Press Ctrl+Space to see a list of fields to choose from.	</p>
        <h2>Placeholders</h2>
        <p>Placeholder documents replace and define the unprocessed files. A file might not be produced for various reasons, most commonly for privileged or technical reasons. 
			When files are only produced in the native and/or text format, an image placeholder will be produced for each file. 
			In this placeholder, information about the file (that is not produced as an image) will be included. A placeholder document is an image Tiff file.</p>
        <h3>Default Placeholder</h3>
        <p>      Select one or more default placeholders.</p>
