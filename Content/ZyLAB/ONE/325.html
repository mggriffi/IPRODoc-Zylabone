        <h1>New Training Batch</h1>
        <p>


  
  When a new <a href="321.html">training batch</a> for an <a href="319.html">issue</a> is added, a new training round/iteration is started.</p>
        <p>Each time a new training batch is added to an issue, the training batch in ZyLAB One will be refreshed. Reviewers will only see the new documents.  Documents reviewed in previous batches remain in the project (together, they form the training set). You will be able to find them, but they will not be part of the training batch reviewers are currently working on.
  
  </p>
        <p>A training batch can be divided in several <a href="317.html">review (sub-)batches</a>. </p>

                <p>The marginal precision is the precision of the last reviewed training batch added to the training set, also called the return set. The marginal precision usually rises to a high value (for example, 67%) in the beginning of the process.</p>
