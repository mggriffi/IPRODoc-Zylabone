        <h1>Text</h1>
        <p>You can choose to produce files in a searchable text format. Searchable text files are likely to be produced in combination with related <a href="1510.html">image</a> files, since images are not searchable.

        <p><b>Why produce text files?</b>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>The main reason for producing text files is that they are searchable and necessary when producing non-searchable image files.

        <p><b>Advantages
  </b>
        </p>
        <p>Searchable text files (.txt) are commonly used for storage of information because of their simplicity. Text files are structured as a sequence of lines of electronic text and avoid most of the problems related with other file formats. They can easily be read or opened by any program that reads text and, for that reason, are considered universal or platform independent.
  </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Disadvantages</b>
        </p>
        <p>Searchable text files often contain text that is redacted from an image during review, since the searchable text files are created before redactions are added to images. When redactions are added to an image,&#160;the related text file is not produced, as it is not possible to redact text files. Even if only a single word on an image is redacted, the related text file will not be produced.
