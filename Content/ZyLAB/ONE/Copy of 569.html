        <h2>Processing</h2>
        <p>Processing reports provide information on the performance of processing jobs and act as a control mechanism to ensure that all files have been handled correctly. To meet the needs of project management, it is important to track the work performed on all items submitted for processing. Every item has tracking information as to the various tasks that have been performed on it. Item level tracking information can result in reports representing overall status or status of any particular item or group of items whether they are ultimately moved forward into review or not.</p>

                        <p>Failed actions of the Archive Extractor are often related to an invalid password.</p>
