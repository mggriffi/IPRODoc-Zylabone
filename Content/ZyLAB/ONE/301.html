        <h2>Classifier</h2>
        <p>The (binary) classifier is a learning algorithm that is used to label documents as being responsive or not responsive for an <a href="319.html">issue</a>.
  
  </p>
        <h3>Ranking</h3>
        <p>The classifier ranks documents with a value (between 0.0 and 1.0). The higher the value, the more responsive the document is.
  </p>
        <p>You can view the ranking of documents in an issue with the ranking column in <a href="document-list.html">Document List</a>. The results of this ranking helps you to determine the <a href="779.html">Classifier Threshold Score</a>.&#160; &#160;
  </p>
        <p> First, select the correct ranking column:
</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Storage/zylab-one-manual-publication/329-2018-07-12.png" alt="" class="Thumbnail" /> </p>
        <p>Then, sort the column ascending or descending:
</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Storage/zylab-one-manual-publication/329-2018-07-12-1.png" alt="" class="Thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <h2>Classifier Threshold Score</h2>
        <p>The Classifier Threshold Score enables you to control which documents in an <a href="319.html">issue</a>&#160;will be&#160;<a href="329.html">classified</a> as responsive or not responsive (when hitting the Classify Remaining button).&#160;</p>
        <p>Define the value of the Classifier Threshold Score based on the <a href="329.html">ranking</a> of the classifier.&#160;Only documents with a&#160;value&#160;higher than (<b>not</b>&#160;equal to) the Classifier Threshold Score will be classified and put in the Classification Results (Assisted Review Results field).
</p>
        <p>The Classifier Threshold Score is set before selecting the Classify Remaining button in the <a href="1030.html">Assisted Review Progress</a> tab:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Storage/zylab-one-manual-publication/new-project-2018-07-12-1.png" alt="" class="Thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <h2>Class Imbalance</h2>
        <p>Class imbalance occurs when you have a data set in which there are only a few responsive documents (positives) and a large number of not responsive documents (negatives). Prevalence values as small as 0,1% are commonly encountered for responsive documents. This class imbalance negatively effects the performance of the <a href="329.html">classifier</a>.</p>
        <h2>Extend Validation Set</h2>
        <p>You can extend the <a href="446.html">Validation Set</a> in the <a href="1030.html">Assisted Review Progress</a> tab.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Storage/zylab-one-manual-publication/555-2018-08-27-1.png" alt="" class="Thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <p>You can always extend the Validation Set. <br />However, remember there is only one Validation Set per project. If you extend the Validation Set for an <a href="319.html">issue</a>, it will be extended for all issues.&#160;It is recommended to review the Validation Set completely before extending it.&#160;</p>
        <p><b>When to extend the Validation Set?</b>
        </p>
        <p>Extend the Validation Set when the size of the Validation Set is not sufficient; There are not enough random documents to make a good estimation of the number of responsive documents in the project. If this is the case, you can see a warning icon next to the <a href="330.html">Estimated Current Recall</a>:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Storage/zylab-one-manual-publication/555-2018-08-27-2.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <p><b>With how many documents will the Validation Set be extended?</b>
        </p>
        <p>The size of the Validation Set will be extended with 10% of the current Validation Set (with a minimum of 50 documents). So for a Validation Set of a 1000 documents, the extension is 100 documents. Click Extend Set again to add another 10%. </p>
        <h2>Issue</h2>
        <p>An issue defines the information need. For example, you want to find information on contracts or human resources.&#160;For each issue, a <a href="321.html">training set</a>&#160;is created.&#160;
  </p>
        <p> All issues are listed in the <a href="1030.html">Assisted Review Progress</a> tab. Here you can view, per issue, the <a href="322.html">Statistics and Graphs</a>&#160;(the results of the Training Set and <a href="446.html">Validation Set</a> and the status of the Training Batch and Validation Set. You can also view the Gain Curve, the Precision of Return Set and the Precision by Recall graph).
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p> In ZyLAB Assisted Review, there are three options for adding an issue:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="listnumber">
                <p>

        <h2>New Training Batch</h2>
        <p>When a new <a href="321.html">training batch</a> for an <a href="319.html">issue</a> is added, a new training round/iteration is started. &#160;</p>
        <p>Each time a new training batch is added to an issue, the training batch in ZyLAB One will be refreshed. Reviewers will only see the new documents. The documents that have been reviewed in previous batches remain in the project (together they form the training set) and you will be able to find them, but they will not be part of the training batch reviewers are currently working on.
  
  </p>
        <p>A training batch can be divided in several <a href="317.html">review (sub-)batches</a>.</p>

        <h2>Ranking</h2>
        <p>Ranking is the document score or <b>relevance score</b> per document. This score is calculated per <a href="319.html">issue</a> for all documents in the project. The higher the score (ranging from 0.1 to 1.0), the more responsive the document is for a specific issue. For each <a href="325.html">new training batch</a>, the relevance score is recalculated and documents with the highest ranking are added to the batch.
  </p>
        <p> In the Document List, you can sort the documents according to this ranking or relevance score:

        <ul class="listbullet">
            <li class="listbullet">

        <h2>Recall Goal</h2>
        <p>The Recall Goal is the user-defined goal (<a href="320.html">stop condition</a>). It is the desired amount (percentage) of responsive documents that you want to find in the whole project.</p>
        <h4>Define the Recall Goal</h4>

        <h2>Review Batch</h2>
        <p>A review batch is a subset of a <a href="321.html">training batch</a>&#160;or <a href="446.html">Validation Set</a>, when working with <a href="1010.html">Assisted Review</a>.  </p>
        <p>However, review batches can also be created when reviewing a large number of documents without Assisted Review. Instead of reviewing one large list&#160;of documents, the documents are divided into easier to handle workloads.
  <br /></p>
        <p>When you have a large training batch, Validation Set or document list, it is recommended to create review batches for multiple reviewers.

  <a href="1030.html">
    Assisted Review Progress</a>&#160;tab. With the help of the statistics and graphs, you can decide if you want to create a <a href="325.html">new training batch</a>&#160;or start with classifying the remaining documents (which means that you have reached a <a href="320.html">stop condition</a>).</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Stop Condition</h2>
        <p>The stop condition defines when reviewers can stop reviewing new documents and the iterative Assisted Review process is terminated. No <a href="325.html">new training batches</a> will be added. You can select Classify Remaining (if not all documents have been reviewed already). The last trained <a href="329.html">classifier</a> is used to classify the remaining documents.</p>
        <p>Several stop conditions can apply. It depends on your project when to stop.

        <h2>Training Set/Batch</h2>
        <p>A <b>training set</b> contains all reviewed documents in a project. The training set is used to train the <a href="329.html">classifier</a>.
  </p>
        <p>A <b>training batch</b> is a selection of documents that might be responsive. All reviewed training batches are part of the training set. A training batch can also be called the return set.
  </p>
        <p>The first or <b>initial training set</b> of an <a href="319.html">issue</a> is the first reviewed training batch.&#160;With each iteration (<a href="325.html">new training batch</a>), the training set grows as more reviewed documents are added to your first training set. A training set is made up of one or more reviewed training batches.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>All training batches are available for review in ZyLAB ONE.&#160;Reviewers select a training batch (or a subset of the training batch; the <a href="317.html">review batch</a>) and tag the documents as responsive or not responsive. 
 Based on their choices, the Assisted Review classifier is trained.&#160;The results of the training (the <a href="322.html">Statistics and Graphs</a>) can be viewed in the <a href="1030.html">Assisted Review Progress</a> tab in Assisted Review.&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>With each new training round, a new training batch will be created for an issue. The previous training batch will not be available anymore via the Facet View, but you can still search all documents that were reviewed.</p>
