        <h1>Stop Condition</h1>
        <p>The stop condition defines when reviewers can stop reviewing new documents and the iterative Assisted Review process is terminated. No <a href="325.html">new training batches</a> will be added. You can select Classify Remaining (if not all documents have been reviewed already). The last trained <a href="329.html">classifier</a> is used to classify the remaining documents.</p>
        <p>Several stop conditions can apply. It depends on your project when to stop.
