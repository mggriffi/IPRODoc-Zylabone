A review batch is a subset of a <a href="321.html">training batch</a>&#160;or <a href="446.html">Validation Set</a>, when working with <a href="1010.html">Assisted Review</a>.
  </p>
        <p>However, review batches can also be created when reviewing a large number of documents without Assisted Review. Instead of reviewing one large list&#160;of documents, the documents are divided into more manageable workloads.
  </p>
        <p>When you have a large training batch, Validation Set or document list, it is recommended that you create review batches for multiple reviewers.
