        <h1>Training Set/Batch</h1>
        <p>A <b>training set</b> contains all reviewed documents in a project. The training set is used to train the <a href="329.html">classifier</a>.
  </p>
        <p>A <b>training batch</b> is a selection of documents that might be responsive. All reviewed training batches are part of the training set. A training batch can also be called the return set.
  </p>
        <p>The first or <b>initial training set</b> of an <a href="319.html">issue</a> is the first reviewed training batch.&#160;With each iteration (<a href="325.html">new training batch</a>), the training set grows as more reviewed documents are added to your first training set. A training set is made up of one or more reviewed training batches.</p>
        <p> All training batches are available for review in ZyLAB ONE.&#160;Reviewers select a training batch (or a subset of the training batch; the <a href="317.html">review batch</a>) and tag the documents as responsive or not responsive. 
 Based on their choices, the Assisted Review classifier is trained.&#160;The results of the training (the <a href="322.html">Statistics and Graphs</a>) can be viewed in the <a href="1030.html">Assisted Review Progress</a> tab in Assisted Review.&#160;
  </p>
        <p>With each new training round, a new training batch will be created for an issue. The previous training batch will not be available anymore via the Facet View, but you can still search all documents that were reviewed.
