        <h1>Search Email</h1>
        <p>Use the following query&#160;to search for email addresses:</p>
        <div class="note"><b>*@?+.*</b>
            <br />
            <br />When necessary add an exclusion list&#160;with commonly used files extensions to decrease the amount of false hits&#160;(e.g. so files with an @ in the name won't be found):<br /><br /><b>*@?+.* -{*.pdf,*.txt,*.doc,*.docx,*.htm,*.html,*.ppt,*.pptx,*.msg,*.xls,*.xlt,*.xlm,*.xlsx,*.jpg,*.png,*.mp3,*.mp4}</b></div>
        <p>Email&#160;is often the best resource for establishing a timeline of communications. In addition, email can be an especially valuable source of evidence in civil or criminal litigation, because people are often less careful in these exchanges than in hard copy correspondence such as written memos and postal letters.&#160;
          </p>
        <p>It is recommended to&#160;<a href="1050.html">create&#160;review batches</a>&#160;so all emails in an email thread are assigned to one person (similar to families). When a reviewer opens an email in Document View, the email thread will be shown in the Conversation panel (on the left side of the screen).&#160;

                <p>An email thread makes it easier to understand the overall structure of a conversation and to make faster and more consistent tagging decisions. An email or conversation thread is an email message and a list of all of the subsequent replies related to the original email.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> The messages are visually grouped and organized in chronological order. Threads are dynamically built when email messages are processed by ZyLAB Legal Processing. When a new message is processed, it will be put in the right place of the thread it belongs to. It is also possible to search for specific emails and email addresses using keyword search.&#160;</p>
