        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <p>      In Document View, on the left side of the screen, the Properties panel is displayed.&#160;Please keep&#160;in mind that UTC times for container files (like zip, tar, rar, etc.) might not be the actual UTC time. Some container files do not have UTC available in their metadata (this can happen in some situations, like how the file was saved/modified), in which case Local time will be stored and treated as if it was UTC.</p>
        <ul class="BulletListBody">
            <li>
                <p>If there are duplicates, warning signs indicate different properties. Hover with your mouse above a warning sign, to view the different values.</p>
            </li>

            </li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This filter will be saved and applied to other documents in Document View, until you change the Properties filter.</p><b><![CDATA[
