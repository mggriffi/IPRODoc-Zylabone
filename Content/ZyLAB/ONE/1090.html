        <h1>Start a Project</h1>
        <p>   A project is filled with documents (from a <a href="create-new-matter.html">matter</a>) that you want to review/analyze with Assisted Review.&#160;Prior to adding documents to a project, you need to assess the data in your matter and determine which and how many documents should be reviewed/analyzed. This depends on a lot of things, like the goal you want to achieve, the data present in the matter, or the data that you expect to&#160;be present in the matter, the number of reviewers, the number of already found responsive documents, etc.
  </p>
        <p>You have various options to choose from when <a href="1011.html">adding a project</a>. The choices you make, define how you want to start&#160;the assisted review process. Be careful: certain choices cannot be reversed. For example, you cannot add a <a href="446.html">Validation Set</a> to an existing project. If you decide later on that you do need a Validation Set, you must add a new project.&#160;&#160;
  </p>
        <p>If you are not sure which options to choose from, please refer to one of the following use cases:</p>
