        <h1>Load File</h1>
        <p>Step five of the production wizard. This is where you define one or more load file formats.&#160;</p>
        <h3>How to start the Production Wizard</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the&#160;<a href="document-list.html">Document List</a>, select the settings icon&#160;<img src="../../Storage/zylab-one-manual-publication/1000-2018-05-29-1.png" alt="" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then, select Productions &gt; Create for Selection/Documents. For more information on starting a production, see&#160;<a href="1500.html">Productions</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Load Files</h2>
        <p><span class="bodytext">A load file organizes and allows access to the data that has been produced. It is used by the receiving party to import the produced data into their own database. A load file contains information that allows the software to carry out certain functions with the data found in the load file. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext"><img src="../../Storage/zylab-one-manual-publication/1505-2018-12-04.png" alt="" class="Thumbnail" /></span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">Electronic data files contain what is commonly referred to as fielded data or metadata. Fielded data is additional, and often valuable, information about the electronic data. It is found in email messages, word processing documents, spreadsheets, and other computer files. In word processing documents, metadata may include prior revisions, revision dates, authors, and other information. Email metadata may identify who was sent a blind copy of a message, which computer created or generated a message, and who opened and viewed a message. 
 </span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">The (potential) production of fielded data, must be discussed before production starts. It is important that the attorneys agree to a list of fields that will (not) be produced. Use this list to map the fields.&#160;</span>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h4>Example of Field Mapping</h4>

        </p>
        <p> &#160;It is not possible to redact fielded data. Fields that should have been redacted should be withheld from production.</p>
        <h3>Select a Load Format</h3>
        <p> Select one or more load formats.&#160;There are various load file formats depending on the software application. Some of the common load files include .DII (Summation) and .OPT/.DAT (Opticon/Concordance).</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Define a Load File</h3>
        <p> Link the source field names to the fields used in the load file.
Prior to production agree to a list of fields that will (not) be produced. Use this list to map the fields.
It is not possible to produce redacted fielded data. Fields that have been redacted should be withheld from production.
