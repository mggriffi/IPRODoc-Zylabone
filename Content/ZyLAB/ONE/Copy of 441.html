        <h1>Near-Duplicates</h1>
        <p>Find near-duplicates of the currently open document. Since it is a time-consuming operation, it must be triggered manually.
</p>
        <div class="note"><![CDATA[  
  ]]><span class="note">Near-Duplicates are found by analyzing the&#160;original document and creating&#160;a query based on the text of the document. This query contains the most frequently used phrases in the original document. After the query is executed, the found documents are compared with each other. Only documents with a similar hit distribution, hit count and document size are considered a near-duplicate.

            <li>
                <p>In Document View, on the right side of the screen, select <b>Near-Duplicates</b>.

                        <p>  The number of&#160;near-duplicates can differ depending on the document you start with. For example, if you request near-duplicates of document A, then the result will contain documents B and C. However, if you request near-duplicates of document B, then you might get A, C and some additional documents that are not similar to A, but similar to B.
