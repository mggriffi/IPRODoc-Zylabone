        <h2>Fields</h2>
        <p>      In Document View,  the Fields panel is located on the left-hand side of the screen. Fields show the metadata of the document displayed in Document View. Fields  are auto-filled with the metadata values associated with the document. </p>
        <ul class="BulletListBody">
            <li>
                <p>If there are duplicates with different properties, then you will be alerted by warning signs. Hover over a warning sign to view the different values.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If container files do not have UTC-information available in their metadata (for instance, due to how the file was modified/saved), then the UTC times assigned to these container files (zip, tar, rar, etc.) might not be their actual UTC times. In these instances, Local time will be stored and treated as the UTC time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To hide the Fields that have not been (auto-)filled, select the <b>Hide empty fields</b> checkbox located at the bottom of the panel.</p>
