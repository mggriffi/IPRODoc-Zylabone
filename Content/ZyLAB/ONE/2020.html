        <h1>CSV</h1>
        <p>  A .CSV (comma-separated values) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form. This file format is often used to exchange data between applications.</p>
        <p>Each line within a .CSV file contains a row of values, which can be numbers or letters, and each value is separated by a comma (or another delimiter). The very first line is a header row containing a list of labels. These labels refer to different columns of values.
