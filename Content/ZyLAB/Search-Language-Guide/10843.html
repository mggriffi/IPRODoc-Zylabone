  Keyword formulations should be based on careful thought, quality control, testing and cooperation between all involved parties. Obtain a small sample from the result list to verify if a search query is valid or not. Adjust the search query to remove nonresponsive data and to ensure that search results are minimally over-inclusive or under-inclusive. Review the search hits, but also review at least some of the documents that were not selected. A quick review might reveal flaws in the search criteria and/or technique.

                            <li class="listnumber">
    Click Search on the Home page or use the Search box when browsing for files.
&#160;<br /></li>
                            <li class="listnumber">
    Insert keywords (or skip this step and continue with defining Document&#160;Fields to search the metadata, Tags and/or Review Status).<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; <br /><p class="listnote">
      To enhance your query you can opt to include alternative terms and/or abbreviations. Try not to use overly general search terms. Be specific. Use current jargon or buzzwords.
      <br /><br />      Use fuzzy search or wild cards to include word variations. For more information, see 
      <a title="Define Terms in Search Query" id="h10874" href="10844.html" target="_self">
        Define Terms in Search Query</a>.
      <br />      Use operators to combine terms or queries with each other. For more information, see&#160;<a title="Connect Terms/Queries in Search Query" id="h10875" href="10846.html" target="_self">Combine Terms/Queries in Search Query</a>.
      <br /><br />      Please be aware that, with complicated searches, you often do not know which parts of the search worked and which did not. Simpler searches can more easily be compared with each other, and you know what worked.
      <br />      Complex searches are often constructed using parentheses. For more information, see 
      <a title="Search Order and Parentheses" id="h10876" href="10829.html" target="_self">
        Search Order and Parentheses</a>.
    </p></li>
                            <li class="listnumber">
    Click&#160;the&#160;triangle icon in the search box&#160;to search your metadata or to limit your search (for example, by defining a date range) using Document Fields.
    <br /><p class="listnote">
      Metadata can also be searched by using keywords directly in the Search box (see step 2). For example, insert 
      <code class="monospace">
        from=john
      </code>
      or 
      <code class="monospace">
        from=null
      </code>
      (in the first example you search for the value 'john' in the field 'from', in the second example you search for empty field values in the field 'from'). Be sure to use the field names displayed in the second list, where no spaces are used (accessed, appointmentend, appointmentstart, assignedto, etc.).
      <br /><br /><b class="specialbold">
        Important Notice</b>: The syntax used for date fields is different when used in the Search box. Instead of dd-mm-yyyy use mm/dd/yyyy. For example, Appointment Start = 22-4-1999 will be - when typed in the Search box -  
      <code class="monospace">
        appointmentstart=04/22/1999
      </code><br />      For more information about date searches, see 
      <a title="Date Restrictions" id="h10877" href="10864.html" target="_self">Date Search</a>.
      <br /><br /><b class="specialbold">
        Please note 
      </b><MadCap:keyword term="Legal Review" />
      that you cannot use regexp in Legal Review in Field Search. For example: 
      <code class="monospace">
        file_name=a+.txt
      </code>
      is possible in TBIE (ZyFIND/Web Client), but will not work in Legal Review.

    When you are finished with defining your search query, click Search.
    <br />    Your hits will be highlighted in the found files. The number of hits (Hit Count) can be seen at the top of the file. Use the arrows to move forward and backward along the hits.</li>
