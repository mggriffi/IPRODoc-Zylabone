        <h1>Searching for evidence</h1>
        <p>When you are ready to start your investigation and search for evidence, there are multiple ways to start. 
 
 
 Different search options are listed below. Depending on the amount of data, the amount of investigators on the case, and how much 
 information is known about the case, certain search options will be more effective in finding relevant documents.

            <ol class="listnumber">
                <li class="listnumber"><b><a href="406.html">Batch search</a></b>
                    <br />          A batch search enables you to execute multiple queries at once. 
 This is useful in an internal investigation, when you want to determine the scope of your data. By executing a list 
 of queries that include keywords and queries that are suspect and could lead to evidence, the amount of hits displayed 
 will give an indication of the scope. This way, you can quickly narrow down the possibly relevant documents and determine the starting point - and place - of your investigation.</li>
                <li class="listnumber"><b><a href="408.html">Topic Modeling</a></b>
                    <br />If you are not sure which information can be found in the collected data, you can use topic modeling to quickly get an overview. 
 You can narrow down topics of interest and start searching manually, or you can select a particular topic and use 
      Assisted Review to look for documents that have similar contents.</li>
                <li class="listnumber"><b><a href="412.html">Browsing</a></b>
                    <br />By browsing through facets, you can quickly narrow down your scope and start searching in specific places in the data. 
 This is useful when you have a clear idea of which information you want to zoom in on.</li>
                <li class="listnumber"><b><a href="413.html">Search queries</a></b>
                    <br />By using search queries, you can conduct specific searches for, for instance, a certain topic, person, and/or time period. Using queries can be a bit  hit or miss, which is why it is recommended to only use search queries 
 once you have narrowed down the data. This can be accomplished by performing a batch search or topic modeling, but also by browsing through facets.<br /></li>
                <li class="listnumber"><b><a href="500.html">Assisted Review</a></b>
                    <br />          Assisted Review enables you to use Artificial Intelligence to search for relevant documents. By starting with a set of documents 
 about a specific topic, a search query, or relevant documents that have been found already, the solution will search for documents 
 that have similar contents. All you need to do, is review the documents. <br /><br /><b style="font-style: italic;">Note</b><i>:</i> 
Assisted Review can also be used check if you might have missed evidence once you conclude your investigation. By starting Assisted Review using the documents 
that contain evidence, the solution will search for documents similar to those. This way, you can verify
if all relevant documents in the data have indeed been found. </li>
