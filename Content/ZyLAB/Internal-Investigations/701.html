                    <br />          All documents added to this production, will be produced as images.

        <p>&#160;<span style="color: #757575;"><b>       Naming
				<br /></b></span></p>
        <p>&#160;Define how you want to name your images. The first three options are most commonly used.
      
			<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><b>Bates Number</b>&#160;
					<br /><a href="1509.html">Bates Number</a> as defined in step 1 of the Production Wizard.
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Bates Number + Extension</b>&#160;
					<br />          The extension (file type) of each document will be added to the bates number.
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Bates Number + Original Name + Extension</b><br />          The original name of the document will be placed between the bates number and the extension (file type).
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Bates Number + Confidentiality + Original Name + Extension</b><br />          If all images are confidential, you can add that to the naming.
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Custom</b><br />          Alternatively, define your own naming convention. Add metadata (fields) from your matter.
		</li></ul></p>
        <p><span style="color: #757575;"><b>Folder Properties
			<br /></b></span>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;Define where you want to store your images.
			<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><b>Name</b><br />          The name of the folder in which the images will be saved.
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Subfolder prefix</b><br />          The subfolder prefix will always be followed by a number.
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Max documents</b><br />          Define the maximum number of documents allowed in a folder.
					         <br />Each image is one page of a document. The images of one document will never be split over two folders. The first document that is too large to fit in one folder, will be placed in its entirety in the new following folder. If the document is still too large for this new folder, it will be placed in this folder nevertheless.
			<br /></li></ul></p>
        <p>&#160;<span style="color: #757575;"><b>        Image Settings
			</b></span><ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><b>Orientation</b><br />          
					Produce all images with the&#160;Portrait,&#160;Landscape or Auto-detect orientation.&#160;With Auto-detect, images can be produced based on the detected orientation of the original document.
					<br />          Images are downscaled to fit (keeping the aspect ratio). They will never be cropped. 
          
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Output format</b><br />          Choose from Singlepage TIFF, Multipage TIFF, Searchable PDF and Searchable PDF (quality).
				<br />Each (Searchable PDF) profile has a different&#160;impact on the quality and performance of the OCR process used to create the searchable PDF. It will have no influence&#160;on the quality of images. It will mostly be noticeable with the text in files of an already lower quality.&#160; <br /><ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet">Singlepage TIFF<br />Creates a TIFF image consisting of 1 page.</li><li class="listbullet">Multipage TIFF<br />Creates a TIFF image consisting of 2 or more pages.</li><li class="listbullet">Searchable PDF<br />Creates a PDF file that can be searched.<br />Choose this option for fast performance, but slightly lower quality&#160;(mostly&#160;noticeable with the text in files of an already lower quality).<br /></li><li class="listbullet">Searchable PDF (quality)<br />Creates a PDF that can be searched.<br />Use this option for high quality, but slower performance. Please note that this option is <i><b>not recommended</b></i> as the performance is considerably slower.<br /></li></ul></li><li class="listbullet"><b>Image size</b><br />          Choose from Letter (8.5x11.0 in/216x279 mm), A4 (8.3x11.7 in/210x297 mm), Legal (8.5x14.0 in/216x356 mm) or Auto (the original image size will be produced; this will overrule the Orientation setting).
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Resolution</b><br />          The lower the resolution, the less disk space you will need. However, the risk of data loss will increase. Choose from 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or 600 dpi.
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Color settings</b><br /><span class="note"><b>Recommended Settings</b><br />For black and white: 1 bit color and 300 dpi<br />					For color: 24 bit color and 200 DPI<br /><br /></span>&#160;<span class="note"><b>Not Recommended</b><br />8 bit color and 8 bit greyscale. Use these option only for specific use cases.</span>
        
        
					When data loss might be an issue, for example when converting from color to black and white, it is advised to produce color images. 
					However, be careful, because the resulting files will take up more space.
          
					<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet"><b>+ Produce as Full Color</b><br />              If you selected 1 or 8 bit, you can produce - as an exception - a number of images in full color (24 bit).
							<br />              Select the file types you want to be produced as full color.
					</li></ul></li><li class="listbullet"><b>Units and Margin</b><br />          The margin can be set in inches or centimeters.
					Fields are burned next to the image. If the margin is set too small, fields will be burned (partly) on top of the image.
          
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Compression</b><br />          You do not need to define the Compression, as it is related to the chosen color&#160;setting. It is displayed here for your convenience.
				</li><li class="listbullet"><b>Remove blank pages</b><br />          This option is often used for spreadsheets. As spreadsheets can be very large, they are often divided into several pages. Information may appear on only a few pages. The remaining blank pages can be removed.
					Sometimes it is not advised to remove blank pages, as this may in itself be important information. For example, someone might have deleted incriminating content.
